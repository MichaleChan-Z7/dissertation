Is this gonna hurt?
Oh, we can try to sedate it
But that never works

There's Nothing Holdin' Me Back,"I wanna follow where she goes
I think about her and she knows it
I wanna let her take control
'cause every time that she gets close, yeah

She pulls me in enough to keep me guessing

Baby, there's nothing holding me back
You take me places
That tear up my reputation
Manipulate my decisions

Treat You Better,"I won't lie to you
I know he's just not right for you
And you can tell me if I'm off
But I see it on your face
When you say that he's the one that you want
And you're spending all your time
In this wrong situation
And anytime you want it to stop

I know I can treat you better
Than he can
And any girl like you
deserves a gentleman
Tell me why are we wasting time
On all your wasted crying
When you should be with me instead
I know I can treat you better
Better than he can

I'll stop time for you
The second you say
You'd like me to
I just wanna give you the loving
That you're missing
Baby, just to wake up with you
Would be everything I need
And this could be so different
Tell me what you want to do

'Cause I know I can treat you better
Than he can
And any girl like you
deserves a gentleman
Tell me why are we wasting time
On all your wasted crying
When you should be with me instead

Have to do this alone

Stitches,"I thought that I've been hurt before
But no one's ever left me quite this sore
Your words cut deeper than a knife
Now I need someone to breathe me back to life

Got a feeling that I'm going under
But I know that I'll make it out alive
If I quit calling you my lover
Move on

You watch me bleed until I can't breathe
Shaking, falling onto my knees
And now that I'm without your kisses
I'll be needing stitches
Tripping over myself
Aching begging you to come help
And now that I'm without your kisses
I'll be needing stitches

Just like a moth drawn to a flame
Oh, you lured me in, I couldn't sense the pain
Your bitter heart cold to the touch
Now I'm gonna reap what I sow
I'm left seeing red on my own

Got a feeling that I'm going under
But I know that I'll make it out alive
If I quit calling you my lover

Never Be Alone,"I promise that one day I'll be around

Hey
I know there are some things

Summer Of Love,"Kisses on your body were like heaven we were taking it slow
Tangled in the sheets until the evening there was nowhere to go
We were in a daze
Learning each other shapes
Tracing shadows of rain down your back
Kisses on your body in my memory baby nothing comes close

It was the summer of love
A delicate daydream
And for a couple of months
It felt like we were 18
It was the summer of
La La Love
It was the Summer of
La La love

Meditation and tequila
Calling you my senorita
Didn't know how much I need ya
Hate it when I have to leave ya
I've been taking mental pictures
For When I miss you in the winter
Staying up until the sunrise
Praying it won't be the last time

It was the summer of love
A delicate daydream
And for a couple of months
It felt like we were 18
It was the summer of
La La Love
It was the Summer of
La La love

Kisses on your body were like heaven we were taking it slow

A Little Too Much,"She would not show that she was afraid
But being and feeling alone was too much to face
Though everyone said that she was so strong
What they didn't know was that she could barely carry on

But she knew that she would be okay

Sometimes it all gets a little too much
But you gotta realize that soon the fog will clear up
And you don't have to be afraid because we're all the same
And we know that sometimes it all gets a little too much

She would always tell herself she could do this
She would use no help it would be just fine
But when it got hard she would lose her focus
So take my hand and it will be alright

Counting Stars,"Lately, I've been, I've been losing sleep
Dreaming about the things that we could be
But baby, I've been, I've been praying hard
Sitting, no more counting dollars

I see this life like a swinging vine
Swing my heart across the line
And my face is flashing signs
Seek it out and you shall find

Young, but I'm not that bold

Different Kind Of Love,"Guess there's something about it
That I can't explain
We could see other people
But it's never the same
You could be in Toronto
And I could be in L. A
And we could wait too long

I'd know our feelings wouldn't change
We've got that different kind of love

No matter what
We've got that different kind of love
We've got that
We don't have to talk
To know this love will never stop
No matter what
We've got that different kind of love

We tried to deny it
Ever since we were kids
Yeah, we both tried to fight it
But we never win
We tell everybody, yeah
That we were just friends
But the more that I kiss you
The less it makes sense

When I call you, you never wanna pick up
Cause everything that I do is never ever enough
You only like it when it rains
And when I'm stuck in the mud

But I just can't get enough
Don't want your love, want your love

You mess me up, and still I come back for more
Don't want your love

I'm not asking for much, I'm just trynna be fair
This road we're on is going nowhere
If we keep on running like a couple of kids
Who just get lost in the woods
And now they're losing their wits
I'm overcome with it, this is ridiculous
How every time we get together, you're the one I miss

I feel powerless and I don't want to split
You run wild, you run wild

Don't want your love, want your love
But I just can't get enough
Don't want your love, want your love

You mess me up, you lay me out on the floor

Cause all this stormy weather's got me running wild
That's it it's now or never, I can't do this forever

Holding you is all I think about
You're asleep in London, I wish you were coming
Back home to me, darling, you're too far away
Count back from one hundred

Full of sunflowers, picking off the petals

I'm no good at waiting, all the separation
Feeling suffocated, I just need to breathe

Eye of The Storm,"This morning I was listening to your heartbeat
I see you by my side, but you're hardly here
You hate me because I'm taking the covers off you
I promise it's just because I love you so much

Honey, I know it's dark, but you're safe here in my arms
I'll be by your side in the eye of the storm
And honey, I know it's hard
I hold you when everything falls apart
I'll be by your side in the eye of the storm

This morning I was listening to your heartbeat music
I see you by my side, but you're hardly here
You hate me because I'm pulling the covers
Catching you out of this bed

I promise it's just because I love you so much
Honey, I know it's dark, but you're safe here in my arms
I'll be by your side in the eye of the storm
And honey, I know it's hard
I hold you when everything falls apart

Happier Than Ever (Billie Eilish Cover in the Live Lounge),"[Chorus]
When I'm away from you
I'm happier than ever
Wish I could explain it better
I wish it wasn't true

[Verse 1]
Give me a day or two to think of something clever
To write myself a letter
To tell me what to do, mm-mm
Do you read my interviews?
Or do you skip my avenue?
When you said you were passin' through
Was I even on your way?
I knew when I asked you to
Be cool about what I was tellin' you
You'd do the opposite of what you said you'd do
And I'd end up more afraid
Don't say it isn't fair
You clearly weren't aware that you made me miserable
So if you really wanna know

[Chorus]
When I'm away from you
I'm happier than ever
Wish I could explain it better
I wish it wasn't true
[Intermission]

[Verse 2]
You call me again, drunk in your Benz
Drivin' home under the influence
You scared me to death, but I'm wastin' my breath
'Cause you only care about your
I don't relate to you
No, I don't relate to you, no
'Cause I'd never treat me this -y
You make me hate this city

[Verse 3]
And I don't talk - about you on the internet
Never told anyone anything bad
'Cause that -s embarrassing, and you were my everything
All that you did was make me - sad
So don't waste the time I don't have
And don't try to make me feel bad
I could talk about every time that you showed up on time
But I'd have an empty line 'cause you never did
Never paid any mind to my mother or friends
So I shut them all out for you 'cause I was a kid

[Outro]
And you ruined everything good
Always said you were misunderstood
Made all my moments your own
Just - leave me alone",Shawn Mendes,Pop
Here,"I'm sorry if I seem uninterested
No I'm not listenin' or I'm indifferent
And truly, I ain't got no business here
But since my friends are here
I just came to kick it but really
I would rather be at home all by myself
not in this room
With people
who don't even care about my well-being
I don't dance, don't ask
I don't need a girlfriend
So you can go back, please
enjoy your party
I'll be here, somewhere in the corner
waiting for this to be over

With this girl who's hollering
I can hardly hear
Over this music I don't listen to
and I don't wanna get with you
So tell my friends that I'll be over here

Oh oh oh here oh oh oh here oh oh oh
I ask myself what am I doing here?
Oh oh oh here oh oh oh here
And I can't wait
till we can break up outta here

Excuse me if I seem a little
unimpressed with this
An anti-social pessimist
but usually I don't mess with this
And I know you mean only the best
And your intentions aren't to bother me
But honestly I'd rather be
Somewhere with my people
we just kick it
And just listen to some music with the message
like we usually do
And we'll discuss our big dreams
How we plan to take over the planet
So pardon my manners
I hope you'll understand it
That I'll be here
Not there in the kitchen with this girl
Who's always gossiping about her friends
So tell them I'll be here
Right next to this boy who's throwing up
Cause he can't take
what's in his cup no more
Oh God why am I here?

Oh oh oh here oh oh oh here oh oh oh
I ask myself what am I doing here?
Oh oh oh here oh oh oh here
And I can't wait
till we can break up outta here

Hours later
congregating next to the refrigerator
Some girl's talking bout her haters
She ain't got none
How did it ever come to this
I shoulda never come to this
So holla at me
I'll be in the car when you're done
I'm standoffish
don't want what you're offering
And I'm done talking
Awfully sad it had to be this way
So tell my people
that I'm ready when their ready
And I'm standing by the Tv with my beanie low
Yo I'll be over here

And I'll be over here
No I'll be over here
No I'll be over here",Shawn Mendes,Pop

Is one that won't ever go away

Take my hand and show me forever
So, never will I ever let you go

So let's hold on together
To this paper and this pen
And write down every letter
To every word we've ever said

All I need to know is where to start
Take my hand and show me forever
So never will I ever let you go

Let's write our story
And let's sing our song
Let's hang our pictures on the wall
All these precious moments
That we carved in stone
Are only memories after all

Memories after all
Memories after all

And oh
You gave me hope
But I've gotta let go
I've gotta let go
Oh woah

It's taking its soul
It's deep in my soul

This Is What It Takes,"I watch your troubled eyes as you rest
And I fall in love with every breath
Wonder if those eyes are really shut
And am I the one you're dreaming of?

Cause underneath the darkness
There's a light that's trying so hard to be seen
And I know this cause I noticed
A little bit shining through the seems

And if this is what it takes
Then let me be the one to bear the pain
If this is what it takes
I'll break down these walls that are in our way
If this is what it takes

You keep on telling me I'm wasting time
But to call it wasting time, oh that's a crime
And you think it's crazy what I'm tryna to
Well baby, I'm a fool for you

Cause underneath the darkness
There's a light that's trying so hard to be seen
And I know this cause I noticed
A little bit shining through the seems

And if this is what it takes
Then let me be the one to bear the pain
If this is what it takes
I'll break down these walls that are in our way

Cause if you don't understand yet
Then I'll never let you forget it
You don't have to do this on your own
I'll be your shoulder to lean on
I'll be your right when you feel wrong
So c'mon take my hand, we're moving on

And if this is what it takes
Then let me be the one to bear the pain
And if this is what it takes
I'll break down these walls

Three Empty Words,"I'll pick you up at the same time
The same places, the same old drive
We'll just talk about our day
To try to fill the awkward space tonight

We'll play the songs we used to love
While we try to fall in love again
We don't know who's wrong or right
We don't even care enough to fight

We're going through the motions

And I know it's gonna hurt
But darling I'll go first
'Cause I won't keep on saying those three empty words
No, I won't keep on saying those three empty words

Though we're still talking everyday
I'm running out of things to say to ya
What's really gonna break my heart
Is to have to tell your little brother

It might be easier to stay
But it'll never be the same, no ohh no
And if something doesn't change
Then we'll keep on sinking further

We're going through the motions
'Cause we can't fix what's broken

And I know it's gonna hurt

I'm tired, I can't take it anymore

Why can't we give love, give love, give love, give love
Give love, give love, give love, give love, give love?

Two bottles of wine just to feel right

But I guess I'm messin' with the wrong guy
And now his ex is textin' him like: Why
Why you gotta be kissin' on my good friends?
I went and told him, yo this has gotta end

Good To Be Alive,"[Verse 1]

about all my problems
I'm living now, I'm living now
I can't sit and worry about the future
I'm living now
I said I'm living now

So put your hands up
if you feel like having a good time
Put your hands up
if you got no cares at all
Raise your cup if
you got no work tomorrow
Put your hands up
if you're ready to have some fun
Come on, sing

Oh oh oh, oh oh oh
Oh, it feels so good to be alive
Oh oh oh, oh oh oh
Oh, it feels so good to be alive

Gonna wake up every day like it's Christmas
Gonna celebrate this life I'm given
From now on (from now on)
Gonna tell my mother every day I love her
And tell her ""thanks for being such a good mother""
From now on

Put your hands up
if you feel like having a good time
Put your hands up
if you got no cares at all
Raise your cup if

Damn, I got mountains to move
And it ain't about how sad it could be
It's about how good it should be

It's Beginning To Look a Lot Like Christmas,"It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas
Everywhere you go
Take a look in the five-and-ten
Glistening once again
With candy canes and silver lanes aglow

It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas
Toys in every store
But the prettiest sight to see
Is the holly that will be
On your own front door

A pair of hop along boots and a pistol that shoots
Is the wish of Barney and Ben
Dolls that will talk and will go for a walk
Is the hope of Janice and Jen
And mom and dad can hardly wait for school to start again

It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas (Christmas)
Everywhere you go
Now there's a tree in the Grand Hotel
One in, the park as well
The sturdy kind that doesn't mind the snow

It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas
Soon all the bells will start
And the thing that will make them ring
Is the carol that you sing
Right within your heart

Hmm, hmm

Oh, it's beginning to look a lot like Christmas (Christmas)

Of a wintry fairy land

And comfy cozy are we
We're snuggled up together
Like two birds of a fеather would be
Let's takе that road before us
And sing a chorus or two
Come on, it's lovely weather
For a sleigh ride together with you

There's a birthday party
At the home of Farmer Gray
It'll be the perfect ending a of perfect day
We'll be singing the songs
We love to sing without a single stop
At the fireplace while we watch
The chestnuts pop. pop! pop! pop!

There's a happy feeling
Nothing in the world can buy
When they pass around the coffee
And the pumpkin pie
It'll nearly be like a picture print
By Currier and Ives
These wonderful things are the things
We remember all through our lives!

Just hear those sleigh bells jingling
Ring ting tingling too

Suicide,"Yes, unspoken, unheard of
The love I feel for you
In my opinion, they don't know
All the things you do

When a million fires are burning
Only you can put them out
On the days the rain is pouring
You can take away the clouds of doubt

It could be fatal, damage my life
Walking away would be suicide
I found an angel to turn on my lights
Walking away would be suicide
And I'm not trying to hurt myself

I couldn't bare to live without you
Thought I was living but now I'm alive
Walking away would be suicide
It would be suicide, suicide
It would be suicide, suicide

I remember a time before you
The dust was in my heights
So tender but then you showed me
All the truth from lies

When a million fires are burning
Only you can put them out
On the days the rain is pouring
You can take away the clouds of doubt

It could be fatal, damage my life
Walking away would be suicide
I found an angel to turn on my lights
Walking away would be suicide
And I'm not trying to hurt myself

I couldn't bare to live without you
Thought I was living but now I'm alive
Walking away would be suicide
It would be suicide, suicide
It would be suicide, suicide

This is no accident
Some days are meant to be
It's not hard to comprehent
You're the reason I'll never leave

It could be fatal, damage my life
Walking away would be suicide
I found an angel to turn on my lights
Walking away would be suicide
And I'm not trying to hurt myself

I couldn't bare to live without you
Thought I was living but now I'm alive

Yule-tide carols being sung by a choir
And folks dressed up like Eskimos
Everybody knows a turkey and some mistletoe
Help to make the seasons bright
Tiny tots with their eyes all aglow
Will find it hard to sleep tonight
They know that Santa's on his way
He's loaded lots of toys and goodies on his sleigh
And every mother's child is gonna spy
To see if reindeer really know how to fly

And so I'm offering this simple phrase
To kids from one to ninety-two
Although it's been said many times, many ways
Merry Christmas to you

Let me show you how to keep the dice
Rolling when you doing that thang over there homie

Lets go!

And I'm feeling like I got to get away, get away, get away
Better know that I don't and I won't stop
Cause you know I gotta win everyday
Day go!
See they really wanna pop me
Blow!
Know that you will never flop me
And I know that I can be a little cocky
You ain't never gonna stop me
Every time I come up pick it I gotta go set it
Then I gotta go
And then I gotta get it, and then I gotta blow them
Then I gotta show that any little thing
That they think they be doing cause it does't matter
Cause I'm gonna da da
Then I'm gonna murder everything and anything
A badaboom a badathing
I gotta do it, I gotta go make it clear to a couple kids
That I'm always winning and I gotta get it again
And again and again
And I be doing this to death
And now I move a little foul
Think I better call a ref
Everybody know my style
And they know I'm the best
When it comes to doing this
And I be banging on my chest
And I'm banging and I'm banging in the West
And I come to give you more, I will never give you less
You can hear it in the street or you can read it in the press
Do you really wanna know whats next
Lets go!
See the way we on then we all up
In the race and you know we gotta go'
Don't to keep up with the pace
And we struggling and hustling and sending it and getting it
And we always gotta do it, take it to another place
Gonna taste it
And I gotta grab it
And I gotta cut all through this traffic
Just to be at the top of the throne
You know I gotta have it

Stop the bleeding

Loving you was cool, and hot, and sweet
Loving you was sunshine, safe and sound
A steady place to let down my defenses
But loving you had consequences

Hesitation, awkward conversation
Running on low expectation
Every siren that I was ignoring
I'm paying for it

Loving you was young, and wild, and free
Loving you was cool, and hot, and sweet

Of when I'll get a chance
There's a world that understands
Where you don't hear the whispers

All I need is a chance

I tell it just wait and see
I know who I'm gonna be

It's gonna wake up and see

Pacing round the room

And you keep me in with those hips
While my teeth sink in into those lips
While your body's giving me life
And you're suffocate my kiss

I did my line
I put on but she's on his phone fronting
Look at him fronting, look, look at him fronting
Cause it's three am and there ain't no sun
And the sign is clear when the phone don't ring
Why? Why?
She said a dream is a wish your heart makes
And he's a sad reality

If the shoe won't fit then I'll walk barefoot to the moon
If you fall when the clock hits the spot then

Back then I managed the crew
At twelve it's just me in my ripped skinny jeans
But I'm still a damn princess to you

Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah

I broke a sweat tryna catch you single blame time
But you're not missing, you want kissing
I'm not asking for your red wine
But could I have you hold me down
I mean is this supposed to be like a date or something?

But he couldn't understand how to be a gentleman
And so the lady said farewell, she deserved better for real
And now he's crying alone
Cause she sassed him with this song

But not close enough, to love you or hate you now
In the morning, you look like an angel
But the devil's buying you a table
Serving a drink, you're making your rounds
Picture it all, I'm out of my mind right now

And everybody told me, so I

I know where you go at the end of the night
Baby, 'cause I got my eyes on you
Tell me that you're home, what a beautiful lie
Baby, 'cause I got my eyes on you
I know that you think I don't
The pictures you had, the numbers in your phone
I know where you go at the end of the night
Baby, 'cause I got my eyes on you

And everybody told me, so I

I know where you go at the end of the night
Baby, 'cause I got my eyes on you
Tell me that you're home, what a beautiful lie

I know that you think I don't
The pictures you have, the numbers in your phone
I know where you go at the end of the night
Baby, 'cause I got my eyes on you

And everybody told me, but I
I had to see it with my own eyes

I know where you go at the end of the night
Baby, 'cause I got my eyes on you
Tell me that you're home, what a beautiful lie
Baby, 'cause I got my eyes on you
I know that you think I don't (I know that you think I don't)
The pictures you have, the numbers in your phone

Feel It Twice,"Oh I'm scared if I look in your eyes
I might see your soul
I know love is the loneliest place
When you fall alone
Sittin' by the phone, holdin' on to
hope
Spendin' all night wonderin', why
you let me go?
I wish you would felt how you feelin'
two years ago

Ahh ah
Hurts me to hurt you baby
Lying awake, and every thing has changed
Keeping a distance lately
Kills me to kill you and I told you that I
Felt it once, I can't feel it twice
It's more than I can take baby
Hurts me to tell you I don't feel the same

Yeah I can feel you still staring at me
when I look away
Can't imagine the pain that you feel
when I kiss his face

That's when you said
How can I be your friend
When I know the way you taste
It's almost 2am
And I can't ask you to stay
Don't know what's worse
Gettin' broken or makin' it break

Ohh

Hurts me to hurt you baby
Lying awake, and every thing has changed
Keeping a distance lately
Kills me to kill you and I told you that I felt it once
I can't feel it twice
It's more than I can take baby
Hurts me to tell you I don't feel the same

Hurts me to hurt you baby
Feels like there's nothin' I can say
Hurts me to hurt you baby
Kills me, I have to walk away
'Cause I felt it once, I can't feel it twice
It's more than I can take, baby
Hurts me to tell you I don't feel the same

It's too late
Too late
Baby I know I'll never find you again
Find you again

Baby, baby, I
Walk in the late night
Looking for your eyes
Put up a fight to find you
Lose it every time
You were like the last of your kind
All of the blames, mine
And I remember you told me
That we could work it all out
Don't you worry
And now the tears in your eyes make it blurry
But if you say try again
I'd be ready
I'm ready (Yeah)

I'll try to pass the night away with somebody new

It's too late

Baby I know I'll never find you again
Find you again

Have mercy on me please
I messed up to the third degree
This crush is kind of crushing me
I do therapy at least twice a week
There's a you-shaped space in my bed
Always you-shaped thoughts inside my head
Like, I keep pushing them right into you
That's the anagram when I remember you
And I remember you told me
That we could work it all out
Don't you worry
And now the tears in your eyes make it blurry

First Man,"Yes, I'm gonna stay with him tonight
I'll see you in the morning
No, of course, he won't drink and drive
Can you say bye to mom for me?
Oh you'll like him, he's really kind
And he's funny - like you sometimes
And I found someone I really like
Maybe for the first time

No, I don't need a jacket
It's not that cold tonight
And you worry, I get it
But he's waiting outside

I swear on my heart that he's a good man
I know you'll stay up late just waiting for me
You held me so tight now someone else can
But you were the first man that really loved me

Now you're driving to the airport
Not just me you pick up anymore
I've got eight days off coming up
And I can only come home for four

Yeah I just met his family
They're just like you and mom
He makes me really happy
I think he might be the one, oh

I swear on my heart that he's a good man
I promise he loves me, he'd never hurt me
You held me so tight now someone else can
But you were the first man that really loved me
Now you're on the driveway faking a smile
You wish you could tell him he doesn't deserve me
So I had to stop the car and turn around
To tell you, ""You were the first man that really loved me. ""

And before they open up the doors
I say, ""I've never seen you cry before. ""
You say, ""You've never looked so beautiful
You know you'll always be my little girl""

You're looking at me, we're walking down the aisle
With tears in your eyes, maybe he deserves me
You don't even know how much it means to me now
That you were the first man that really loved me

Oh, that really loved me, oh
You really love me",Camila Cabello,Pop

Asking you what's on your mind

Together making love in the afternoon
But I'm forgetting what it's like to wake up next to you
And this is what I go through, baby

Said you're working, you're working all the time

Say You Won't Let Go & Her Song (Mashup) [Bbc's Radio 1 Live Lounge],"Machine Gun Kelly
I met you in the dark
You lit me up
You made me feel as though, I
I was enough
We danced the night away
We drank too much
I held your hair back when
You were throwing up

Camila Cabello
Then you smiled over your shoulder
For a minute, I was stone cold, sober
I pulled you closer to my chest
And you asked me to stay over
I said, I already told ya
I think that you should get some rest

I knew I loved you then
But you'd never know
'Cause I played it cool
when I was scared of letting go
I knew I needed you
But I never showed
But I wanna stay with you
Until we're grey and old
Just say you won't let go
Just say you won't let go

Machine Gun Kelly
And I never thought for a minute
If you showed me a picture of my life now
that you wouldn't be in it
Took me a couple years to say I loved you
but I meant it when I said it
Wasn't much of a romantic, but you get it
Didn't really smoke, but when I rolled it up
you hit it
And we lit it up - shotgunning our kisses
I used to have someone at 3 am that I could call
Now it just rings and I don't get nothing at all
Where you at girl?

Camila Cabello (Machine Gun Kelly)
When you looked over your shoulder (yeah)
For a minute, I forget that I am older (yeah)
I wanna dance with you right now (right now) , ooh
You look as beautiful as ever (hey)
And I swear that everyday you will get better (right)
You make me feel this way somehow

I'm so in love with you
I hope you know
Darling your love is more than worth its weight in gold
We've come so far my dear
Look how we've grown
And I wanna stay with you
Until we're grey and old

Just say you won't let go

Even when we're ghosts

When I needed you most

Just cross the border and into the city
You and I can both get jobs
And finally see what it means to be living.

You see my old man's got a problem
He lives with the bottle, that's the way it is
He says his body's too old for working
I say his body's too young to look like this
My mama went off and left him
She wanted more from life than he could give
I said somebody's got to take care of him
So I quit school and that's what I did.

You've got a fast car
But is it fast enough so we can fly away?
We have got to make a decision
We leave tonight or live and die this way

So remember when we were driving, driving in your car
Speed so fast feel like I was drunk
City lights lay out before us
And your arm felt nice wrapped round my shoulder
And I had the feeling that I belonged
And I had a feeling I could be someone, be someone,
be someone

You've got a a fast car
And we go cruising entertain ourselves,
You still ain't got a job
Now I work in a market as a checkout girl
I know things will get better
You'll find work and I'll get promoted
We'll move out of the shelter
Buy a bigger house and live in the suburbs

So remember when we were driving, driving in your car
Speed so fast feel like I was drunk
City lights lay out before us
And your arm felt nice wrapped round my shoulder
And I had the feeling that I belonged
And I had a feeling I could be someone, be someone,
be someone

You've got a fast car
And I've got a job that pays all our bills
You stay out drinking late at the bar see more of your friends
Than you do of your kids
I'd always hoped for better
Thought maybe together you and me would find it
I've got no plans and I aint going nowhere
So take your fast car and keep on driving

Matters Of The Heart,"I lose my head
From time to time
I make a fool of myself
In matters of the heart

We should have been holding each other
Instead we talked
I make a fool of myself
In matters of the heart

But I asked before
Your reply was kind and polite
One wants more
When one's denied
I make a fool of myself
In matters of the heart

I won't call it love
But it feels good to have passion in my life
If there's a battle
I hope my head always defers to my heart
In matters of the heart

I guess I'm crazy to think
I can give you what you don't want
I make a fool of myself
In matters of the heart

I wish that I had the power
To make these feelings stop
I lose all self control
In matters of the heart

I can't believe
It's so hard to find someone
To give affection to
And from whom you can receive
I guess it's just the draw of the cards
In matters of the heart

You caught me off guard
Somehow you reached me
Where I thought I had nothing left inside
I've learned my lesson I've been edified
In matters of the heart

I've spent my nights
Where the sleeping dogs lie
Not by your side
It feels so lonely
Once again I've left to much to chance
In matters of the heart

Here I sit
I'm feeling sorry for myself
It's quite a sight
But I have you to thank
For reminding me
We're all alone in this world
And in matters of the heart

I'm already missing you
Although we won't say good-byes
Until tomorrow afternoon
Maybe when and if I see you again
We'll see eye to eye
In matters of the heart

I have no harsh words for you
I have no tears to cry
If the moon were full
I'd be howling inside
It only hurts
In matters of the heart

If today were my birthday
I'd be reborn
As Bronte's bird a bird that could fly
And all accounts would be settled
In matters of the heart

They might take away my life
I don’t want no one to squeeze me
They might take away my life
I just want someone to hold me
And rock me through the night

This youthful heart can love you, yes, and give what you need
I said, this youthful heart can love you, boy, and give what you need
But I’m too old to go chasing you around wasting my precious energy

Give me one reason to stay here, yes, and I’ll turn right back around
Give me one reason to stay here, whow, and I’ll turn right back around
I said, I don’t want leave you lonely
You got to make me change my mind

Baby just give me one reason
Oh! Give me just one reason why
Baby just give me one reason
Oh! Give me just one reason why I should stay
I said I told you that I loved you, and there ain't no more to say",Tracy Chapman,Pop
Change,"If you knew that you would die today,
If you saw the face of God and Love,
Would you change? Would you change?

If you knew that love can break your heart,
When you're down so low you cannot fall,
Would you change? Would you change?

How bad, how good does it need to get?
How many losses, how much regret?
What chain reaction would cause an effect?
Makes you turn around, makes you try to explain,
Makes you forgive and forget, makes you change?

If you knew that you would be alone,
Knowing right, being wrong,
Would you change? Would you change?

If you knew that you would find a truth,
That brings up pain that can't be soothed,
Would you change? Would you change?

How bad, how good does it need to get?
How many losses, how much regret?
What chain reaction would cause an effect?
Makes you turn around, makes you try to explain,
Makes you forgive and forget, makes you change?
Makes you change

Are you so upright you can't be bent?
If it comes to blows are you sure you won't be crawling?
If not for the good, why risk falling?

If everything you think you know,
Makes your life unbearable,
Would you change? Would you change?

If you'd broken every rule and vow
And hard times come to bring you down,
Would you change? Would you change?

If you knew that you would die today,
If you saw the face of God and Love,
Would you change? Would you change?
Would you change? Would you change?

If you saw the face of God and Love,
If you saw the face of God and Love,
Would you change? Would you change?",Tracy Chapman,Pop
The Promise,"If you wait for me then I'll come for you
Although I've travelled far
I always hold a place for you in my heart

If you think of me, if you miss me once in awhile
Then I'll return to you, I'll return and fill that space in your heart

Remembering your touch, your kiss, your warm embrace
I'll find my way back to you
If you'll be waiting

If you dream of me like I dream of you
In a place that's warm and dark
In a place where I can feel the beating of your heart

Remembering your touch, your kiss, your warm embrace
I'll find my way back to you
If you'll be waiting

I've longed for you and I have desired to see your face, your smile
To be with you wherever you are

Remembering your touch, your kiss, your warm embrace
I'll find my way back to you
Please say you'll be waiting

Together again
It would feel so good to be in your arms
Where all my journeys end

Behind The Wall,"Last night I heard the screaming
Loud voices behind the wall
Another sleepless night for me
It won't do no good to call
The police
Always come late
If they come at all

Last night I heard the screaming
Loud voices behind the wall
Another sleepless night for me
It won't do no good to call
The police
Always come late
If they come at all

And when they arrive
they say they can't interfere
With domestic affairs
Between a man and his wife
And as they walk out the door
The tears well up in her eyes

Last night I heard the screaming
Then a silence that chilled my soul
I prayed that I was dreaming
When I saw the ambulance in the road

And the policeman said
""I'm here to keep the peace
Will the crowd disperse
I think we all could use some sleep""

Last night I heard the screaming
Loud voices behind the wall
Another sleepless night for me
It won't do no good to call
The police
Always come late

A Hundred Years,"Baby sweet baby
Won't you please
Come on back home to me
I've been so lonely
These few days feel like
A hundred years


How you make me worry baby
How you make me worry about you
Here I am I'm knowing
That I can't live without you
Here I am thinking
Someday we make this a long time thing
Here I am I'm knowing
That I would do most anything
If you keep on loving me
Baby


Baby sweet baby
I've been waiting
Seem like waiting is all I do
Don't say you won't come back to me
And make me have to go out chasing after you
We get in a fight
You stay out late
You have no idea
How much you make me worry baby
Called everyone in town
I think you know
So come on now
Come on come on
Back home


Baby sweet baby
I'm a fool in love
But I still got my pride too
I'll wait a little longer
I'll suffer for my heart
Then I'll go find someone to worry about me
As much as I worry about you",Tracy Chapman,Pop
Why,"Why ?
Why do the babies starve
When there's enough food to feed the world
Why when there're so many of us
Are there people still alone
Why are the missiles called peace keepers
When they're aimed to kill
Why is a woman still not safe
When she's in her home
Love is hate
War is peace
No is yes
And we're all free
But somebody's gonna have to answer
The time is coming soon
Admidst all these questions and contradictions
There're some who seek the truth
But somebody's gonna have to answer
The time is coming soon
When the blind remove their blinders
And the speechless speak the truth

Space Between,"There is fiction in the space between
The lines on your page of memories
Write it down but it doesn't mean
You're not just telling stories

There is fiction in the space between
You and reality
You will do and say anything
To make your everyday life
Seem less mundane
There is fiction in the space between
You and me

There's a science fiction in the space between
You and me
A fabrication of a grand scheme
Where I am the scary monster
I eat the city and as I leave the scene
In my spaceship I am laughing
In your remembrance of your bad dream
There's no one but you standing

Leave the pity and the blame
For the ones who do not speak
You write the words to get respect and compassion
And for posterity
You write the words and make believe
There is truth in the space between

There is fiction in the space between
You and everybody
Give us all what we need
Give us one more sad sordid story
But in the fiction of the space between
Sometimes a lie is the best thing
Sometimes a lie is the best thing",Tracy Chapman,Pop

I'm ready to let the rivers wash over me

If the waters can redeem me

I'm ready to let the rivers wash over me
I'm ready to let the rivers wash over me

If not today then
Why make your promises
A love declared for days to come
Is a good as none

You can wait' til morning comes
You can wait for the new day
You can wait and lose this heart
You can wait and soon be sorry

Now love's the only thing that's free
We must take it where it's found
Pretty soon it may be costly

If not now what then
We all must live our lives
Always feeling
Always thinking

Mountains O' Things,"The life I've always wanted
I guess I'll never have
I'll be working for somebody else
Until I'm in my grave
I'll be dreaming of a life of ease
And mountains o'things

To have a big expensive car
Drag my furs on the ground
And have a maid that I can tell
To bring me anything
Everyone will look at me with envy and with greed
I'll revel in their attention
And mountains
Oh mountains o'things

Sweet lazy life
Champagne and caviar
I hope you'll come and find me
Cause you know we are
Those who deserve the best in life
And know what money's worth
And those whose sole misfortune
Was having mountains o' nothing at birth

Oh they tell me
There's still time to save my soul
They tell me
Renouce all
Renouce all those material things you gained by
Exploiting other human beings

Consume more than you need
This is the dream
Make your pauper
Or make you queen
I won't die lonely
I'll have it all prearranged
A grave that's deep and wide enough
For me and all my mountains o' things

Mostly I feel lonely
Good good people are
Good people are only
My stepping stones
It's gonna take all my mountains o' things
To surround me
Keep all my enemies away
Keep my sadness and loneliness at bay

I'll be dreaming, dreaming, dreaming....

Across The Lines,"Across the lines
Who would dare to go
Under the bridge
Over the tracks
That seperates whites from blacks

Choose sides
Or run for your life
Tonight the riots begin
On back streets of America
They kill the dream of America

Little black girl gets assaulted
Ain't no reason why
Newspaper prints the story
And racist tempers fly
Next day it starts a riot
Knives and guns are drawn
Two black boys get killed
One white boy goes blind

Little black girl gets assaulted
don't no one know her name
Lots of people hurt and angry
She's the one to blame",Tracy Chapman,Pop
Save Us All,"I know Jesus loves me
In my heart I know it's true
I know Mary's little baby
Came into the world
Just to save me
But I don't know about you

My Gods a mighty big God
My God can shake the world up
Plagues and famines
Frogs and locusts
Walking on water
Burning bushes
Rolling the thunder
And parting the waters too

My God is good in the kitchen
Make a good meal from bread and fishes
Feed the hungry pour the wine
Everybodys welcome to have a good time
Sit at his table enjoy the food

I know Jesus loves me
He says I should love you
My neighbor not his wife
Don't covet steal kill or lie
My Gods got a lot of rules

My God made creation
Six days work one day vacation
Made a garden
Filled it with apples
Adam and Eve walked around natural
Until they are that one piece of bad fruit

I've heard that your Gods older
Buddha Allah Krishna
Manifest with many faces
Worshipped the world over in foreign places
I assume your God must love you

I know Jesus loves me
And my God is good and great and true
But if pride goeth before the fall
I hope someones God will save us all
Save us all
And love the sinners too",Tracy Chapman,Pop
Bridges,"All the bridges that you burn
Come back one day to haunt you
One day you'll find you're walking
Lonely

Baby I
Never meant to hurt you
Sometimes the best intentions
Still don't make things right

But all my ghosts they find me
Like my past they think they own me
In dreams and dark corners they surround me
Till I cry I cry

Let me take this time to set the record straight
Let me take this time to take it all back
Let me take this time to tell you how I felt
Let me take this time to try and make it right

But you can
Walk away
Be all alone
Spend all your time
Thinking about the way things used to be
If love feels right
You work it out
You don't give it up
Baby

Anybody tell you that
Anybody tell you that
Anybody tell you that

You should take some time maybe sleep on it tonight
You should take some time baby heed the words I say
You should take some time think about your life
You should take some time before you throw it all away

I ain't got the time
To sit here and wait around
But I got the time
If you say I'm what you want

3000 Miles,"Good girls walk fast
In groups of three
Fast girls walk slow
On side streets
Sometimes the girls who walk alone
Aren't found for days or weeks

On the busy boulevards
Bad boys call you names
And cruise you hard
Bullies laugh and grin and beat
Your soft skin against
The cold concrete

I'm 3,000 miles away
I'm 3,000 miles away
I'm 3,000 miles away
I'm 3,000 miles away

Knock you down
Make you bleed
Make you cry
And make you think
I'll die here soon if I don't leave
If I don't leave if I don't leave

This patch of sky and native ground
Take turns to push and pull you down
Forget trying to live and be happy
I'll take safe and terror free

I'm 3,000 miles away
I'm 3,000 miles away
I'm 3,000 miles away
I'm 3,000 miles away

Hit the floor
Shut off the lights
As the bullets fly
Terror rules the dark night
Dogs hang from the trees

Training ground for punks and thieves
Home of poor white retirees
Who didn't bail
And couldn't sell
When color made the grass less green

I'm 3,000 miles away
I'm 3,000 miles away
I'm 3,000 miles away
I'm 3,000 miles away

Apples are filled with razor blades
But fools and innocents believe
That love and faith and truth and beauty
Can make a garden of this human factory

I'm 3,000 miles away
I'm 3,000 miles away
I'm 3,000 miles away
I'm 3,000 miles away

Bad girls run fast
Leave home alone
No trace or clue of where they've gone
Sometimes these girls are never found
Never found never found

Ask for your consideration
Ask you out on a date
Although it can't be sure
Why not act on a hunch
Oh why not search for proof
Why not go out for lunch
And in theory, I could propose
And in theory you could affirm
Oh that you were meant for me
And for you I'm the one
Oh that you were meant for me

Say she wanna spare the children

Hunger only for a taste of justice
Hunger only for a world of truth

I had dreams I had high hopes
I married a man he stole my heart away
He gave his love but what a high price I paid
And all that you have is your soul

Why was I such a young fool
Thought I’d make history
Making babies was the best I could do
Thought I’d made something that could be mine forever
Found out the hard way one can’t possess another
And all that you have is your soul

I thought thought that I could find a way
To beat the system
To make a deal and have no debts to pay
I’d take it all take it all I’d run away
Me for myself first class and first rate
But all that you have is your soul

Here I am waiting for a better day
A second chance
A little luck to come my way
A hope to dream a hope that I can sleep again
And wake in the world with a clear conscience and clean hands

I've done so many things wrong I don't know if I can do right
If you put your trust in me I hope I won't let you down
If you give me a chance I'll try
You see it's been a hard road the road I'm traveling on
And if I take your hand I might lead you down the path to ruin
I've had a hard life I'm just saying it so you'll understand
That right now, right now, I'm doing the best I can

At this point in my life
At this point in my life
Although I've mostly walked in the shadows
I'm still searching for the light
Won't you put your faith in me
We both know that's what matters
If you give me a chance I'll try
You see I've been climbing stairs but mostly stumbling down
I've been reaching high always losing ground
You see I've been reaching high but always losing ground
You see I've conquered hills but I still have mountains to climb
And right now right now I'm doing the best I can
At this point in my life

Before we take a step
Before we walk down that path
Before I make any promises
Before you have regrets
Before we talk commitment
Let me tell you of my past
All I've seen and all I've done
The things I'd like to forget

At this point in my life
At this point in my life
I'd like to live as if only love mattered
As if redemption was in sight
As if the search to live honestly
Is all that anyone needs
No matter if you find it

You see when I've touched the sky
The earth's gravity has pulled me down
But now I've reconciled that in this world
Birds and angels get the wings to fly
If you can believe in this heart of mine
If you can give it a try
Then I'll reach inside and find and give you
All the sweetness that I have
At this point in my life

That the nature of life is chaos and confusion
That man's rules of law and order
May not stand

And I should be and be not afraid

The true heart's needs
But my pride may bring me low
Unable to see
I'm no closer than yesterday
But tomorrow I may stand

And be and be not afraid
To reach for heaven

I'll see the black car cavalcade
Lights on in the morn
I'll run fast and far away
I'll run without stopping
'Til hear and feet fail
Or until I can stand

Broken,"You can close your eyes
And see a picture perfect life
Inside your mind
Dreaming only of the days ahead
wanted and wished for more than now
Or the days behind
You waste your time

The picture makes a promise
The flesh lets it be broken
The picture makes a promise
The flesh lets it be broken

You can never think
You can't even stop yourself
Before the words have been spoken
And you've already said
You would give everything
And something for nothing
Everybody thinks you're joking

The picture makes a promise
The flesh lets it be broken
The picture makes a promise
The flesh lets it be broken

You want to be the one
Made over be your own
Before and after
And the supermarket
Beauti in a bottle queen
Who'll one day grace a
cheek-out counter
Magazine front cover
Though the fine print reads

The picture makes a promise
The flesh lets it be broken
The picture makes a promise
The flesh lets it be broken

Lets it be broken
Lets it be broken
Broken
Lets it be broken
Lets it be broken
Broken
Broken

When your life is never what you wanted
Not even halfway normal
Just tarnished and soiled
When in your reach
A framed and frozen moment
So far from perfection
Not truth or transcendence
Will set you free
Still you don't belive

The picture makes a promise
The flesh lets it be broken
The picture makes a promise
The flesh lets it be broken",Tracy Chapman,Pop
Cold Feet,"There was a little boy once upon a time
Who in spite of his young age and small size knew his mind
For every copper penny and clover he would find
Make a wish for better days the end of hard times
For no more cold feet
Cold cold cold cold feet
His clothes were always clean
His face was always scrubbed
There was food on the table enough to fill him up
His house was full of life His house was full of love
But when winter days arrived
There was never money enough to shod his cold feet
Cold cold cold cold feet

He grew up to be a worker determined to succeed
He made a life for himself, free from worldly wants or needs
But with nobody to share the life he'd made
No body to keep him warm at night
When he'd go to sleep he'd sleep alone with his cold feet
Cold cold cold cold feet

One night he walked the street looking to the heaven's above
Searching for a shooting star a benevolent God
When a woman passing by brushed his arm
He turned and found love
He then wished for the courage to ask this stranger
Who she was to not have cold feet
Cold cold cold cold feet

He thought she'd like the party life and want the finer things
So he promised more than he could buy
And he promised her the sun and moon to not have cold feet
Cold cold cold cold feet

He worked day and night his fingers to the bone
Hi worried mind guilty conscience drive him on
He can't give her what she needs
He wants to give her what he thinks she wants
Her sad-eyed face, his empty pockets drive him on and his cold feet
Cold cold cold cold feet

He'd struggled all his life to be an honest man
Proud that the dirt on his palms was the soil of the land
But some guys he knew from high school days
Said they had a plan to get rich quick
And they could count him in if he don't have cold feet
Cold cold cold cold feet

He thought about their offer accepted it without qualms
Dreamt about the life he'd buy
The comfort that would come without cold feet
Cold cold cold cold feet

He decided to tell his wife things would soon turn around
He said the little boy is dead
A man stands with you now without cold feet
Cold cold cold cold feet
Without cold feet - Cold cold cold cold feet

He thought he'd set his clock right - He though he'd read his watch
He left in such a hurry he didn't think to wish for luck
Makes no difference if you're early - No difference if you're late
When you're out of time - The flowers have been laid
You're six feet underground
With cold feet
Cold cold cold cold feet",Tracy Chapman,Pop
Conditional,"It's conditional

Crossroads,"All you folks think you own my life
But you never made any sacrifice
Demons they are on my trail
I'm standing at the crossroads of hell
I look to the left I look to the right
There's hands that grab me on every side
All you folks think I got my price
At which I'll sell all that is mine
You think money rules when all else fails
Go sell your soul and keep your shell
I'm trying to protect what I keep inside
All the reasons why I live my life
Some say the devil be a mystical thing
I say the devil he a walking man
He a fool he a liar conjurer and a thief
He try to tell you what you want
Try to tell you what you need
Standing at the point
The road it cross you down
What is at your back
Which way do you turn
Who will come to find you first
Your devils or your gods
All you filks think you run my life
Say I should be willing to compromise
I say all you demons go back to hell
I'll save my soul save myself",Tracy Chapman,Pop
Devotion,"If I am right
If I can be
Constant and faithful
You'll find me

In my devotion
In my devotion

What if you find a fault
Between my purpose and my deeds
And deem me beyond salvation
Judge me to be unworthy

Of your devotion
Of your devotion

If this be obsession deliver me
A passing infatuation deliver me
A feeling lacking in purity deliver me
A test of fidelity deliver me
Deliver me
Deliver me

What if I should find
You're no good for me
What if I can't be strong enough
What if I can't break free

Of my devotion

Don't Dwell,"Don't dwell on the past
Of there was lost and didn't last
That summer bloom is fading fast
But I'm falling for you

Don't dwell on the pain
The tears you've cried
An autumn rain
That fair weather's here and gone again
But I'm waiting for you

Don't dwell on the loss
The fool that would steal break and toss
That winter's heart will spurn and double-cross
But I'm yearning for you

Don't dwell on the time
The seasons change
And so does the clime
That old flame has cooled
But I'm burning for you",Tracy Chapman,Pop
Dreaming On A World,"I know I may be wishing
On a world
That may never be
But I'll keep on wishing

No matter how hopeless
Or foolish
It may seem
I'll keep on wishing

I'll toss my coins in the fountain
Look for clovers in grassy lawns
Search for shooting stars in the night
Cross my fingers and dream on

I know I may be dreaming
Of a world
Far from present day reality
But I'll keep on dreaming

No matter how unrealistic
Or naive
It may seem
Always keep dreaming

And toss your coins in the fountain
Look for clovers in grassy lawns
Search for shooting stars in the night
Cross your fingers and dream on

We must always be thinking
Of a world
As a place of infinite possibilities
And always keep thinking

No matter how hopeless
Or foolish
It may seem
Always keep thinking

And toss our coins in the fountain
Look for clovers in grassy lawns
Search for shooting stars in the night
Cross our fingers and dream on

I'll keep on wishing
We must always keep dreaming
Of a world
With equality and justice
Thinking
There could be a world
Without poverty and sickness
Wishing
Of a world
Without hunger and homelessness
Dreaming
Of a world
Where all people live in peace

Of a world

For a Dream,"I picture us together
Framed in gold leaf
On the mantle with the others
One big happy family
But that snapshot can't be found
And I don't trust my memory

But it's alright it's alright
For a dream

I imagine we are gathered
But this time not dressed in black
There's laughing and smiling
Not stabbing in the back
But it's too good to be true
And too bad I still recall the screams

[Chorus]

I keep half the picture
Mostly in my mind
Mama dressed in white
Ripped when she held your hand
Showing no signs of age
Just slightly frayed along the seam

[Chorus]

It's alright
All that I can claim
It's alright
And it will have to do
It's alright
Better than the pain
It's alright
Better than the truth
It's alright
Alright for a dream
It's alright
Better than fate and the great scheme
It's alright
It's alright

For christmas and for New Year
I wish and I resolve
But I'm disappointed by myself
Jesus and Santa Claus
I want to believe
She's been saved
And he's be redeemed

And it's alright it's alright

For My Lover,"Two weeks in a Virginia Jail
For my lover for my lover
Twenty thousand dollar bail
For my lover for my lover

That I'm the fool
But they don't get
Any love from you

The things we won't do for love
I'd climb a mountain if I had to
And risk my life so I could have you
You, you, you...

Everyday I'm psycoanalyzed
For my lover for my lover
They dope me up and I tell them lies
For my lover for my lover

And everybody thinks
That I'm the fool

And risk my life so I could have you

And leave my head to ponder
Deep in this love
No man can shake

I follow my heart
And leave my mind to wonder
Is this love worth
The sacrifices I make

Two weeks in a Virginia Jail
For my lover for my lover
Twenty thousand dollar bail
For my lover for my lover

Everyday I'm psycoanalyzed
For my lover for my lover
They dope me up and I tell them lies

Look at me losing control
Thinking I had a hold
But with feelings this strong
I'm no longer the master
Of my emotions

Freedom Now,"They throwed him in jail
And they kept him there
Hoping so he'd die
That his body and spirit would waste away
And soon after that his mind

But every day is born a fool
One who thinks that he can rule
One who says tomorrow's mine
One who wakes one day to find

The prison doors open the shackles broken
And chaos in the street
Everybody sing we're free free free free
Everybody sing we're free free free free
Everybody sing we're free free free free

They throwed him in jail
And they kept him there
Hoping his memory'd die
That the people forget how he once led
And fought for justice in their lives

But every day is born a man
Who hates what he can't understand
Who thinks the answer is to kill
Who thinks his actions are god's will

And he thinks he's free free free free
Yes he thinks he's free free free free
He thinks he's free free free free

Soon must come the day
When the righteous have their way
Unjustly tried are free
And people live in peace I say
Give the man release
Go on and set your conscience free
Right the wrongs you made
Even a fool can have his day

Let us all be free free free free
Let us all be free free free free
Let us all be free free free free

Free our bodies free our minds
Free our hearts
Freedom for everyone
And freedom now
Freedom now
Freedom now
Freedom now

Let us all be free free free free
Let us all be free free free free
Let us all be free free free free",Tracy Chapman,Pop
Going Back,"No picnic no barbecue out in the back
A yard for parked cars left to rot and forget
For chained-up mad dogs for garbage to sit
Get lost get lost a part from it

I can't see through it
But i can see past
With me with me always
Without going back

Just people and buildings
Not city or town
Great lake crooked river
Flat land water burns
The air not smoke
It tears the eye
Home is where you live
Home is where you'll die

I can't see through it
But i can see past
With me with me always
Without going back

In a glacial slide
Over ice mirrored glass
In a slip and past times
Are in the future brought back
Reflected reflected reflected
Every footstep

No walk in the park
No there is nowhere
No place can replace
What a clear eye reveals
Soft and hard shaped like a wheel
Made me of rubber made me of steel

I can't see through it
But i can see past
With me with me always
Without going back

Goodbye,"For you
It's all in a day
One day in a life
It's all in the one word
The one word is goodbye

For me
It's all in what you say
Though you've tried to be kind
It's all in the words
From the lips that once touched mine with a sigh
Goodbye

For you
It's all in your face
The laugh and worry lines
It's all in the one word
You hope will make you young again
Goodbye

It's all in the play
Someone speaks the line
It's all in the one word
That stops and steals the time
Goodbye

It's the part in life
When it's all in the words
To fate and circumstance resigned

Look for God and life on distant planets

While each of us holds inside the map to the labyrinth

In our respect for what is earthly
In our unfaltering belief in peace and love and understanding

Of ordinary people leading ordinary lives
Filled with love, compassion, forgiveness and sacrifice

Heaven's in our hearts
In our faith in humankind
In our respect for what is earthly
In our unfaltering belief in peace and love and understanding

Look around
Believe in what you see
The kingdom is at hand
The promised land is at your feet
We can and will become what we aspire to be

If Heaven's here on earth
If we have faith in humankind
And respect for what is earthly
And an unfaltering belief that truth is divinity
And heaven's here on earth

I've seen spirits
I've met angels
I've touched creations beautiful and wondrous
I've been places where I question all I think I know
But I believe, I believe, I believe this could be heaven
We are born inside the gates with the power to create life
And to take it away
The world is our temple
The world is our church

And an unfaltering belief
In peace and love and understanding

Stayed up for days
Partied hard
Lived my twenties in haze
Smoked second-hand in crowded bars
With the A-list of B-list movie stars

Pat me down and undress me
I'll confest without miranda
Strike a pose for the tabloid cameras

Is not an exhibition

Crash and burn
And then you know you're living

Some pain a few tears after
I did it all
To the last line of the final chapter
I did it all
I did it all

My heart is a wound that festers
Seduced my share in silk and polyester
Oh my great loves
And my few losses
I'll tell it all
When my little black book is published

When they come to interview me
For my made for TV movie
Say I'm the bitch who was a bastard
Who did it all for the love and laughter

In The Dark,"Make me fumble
Make me fall
Make my heart stop and start
To tremble uncontrollably
Let my eyes see fear make desire
Keep those who long apart
Forbid the kiss
And leave us innocent
Of the things some do in the dark

The things some do in the dark
The things some do in the dark

Make me remember
Make me forget
Make my mind unable
To force the body to do its will
Let it be right for belief and denial
To share a space in the heart and leave us only to imagine
About the things some do in the dark

The things some do in the dark
The things some do in the dark

Make me pretend
Make me expect
Things can go and come to pass
Without trial or tribulation
Let this life space and time
Leave my body with permanent marks
Faded scars and lines
But not a single impression
Of the things some do in the dark

The things some do in the dark
The things some do in the dark

Let me be tempted
Let me be torn
But make my thoughts pure and not
Morally corrupt in form
Let us sleep tonight
Let innocence lie in our dreams and secret hearts
With burning desire
A need to know and do
The things some do in the dark

The things some do in the dark
The things some do in the dark

You can be pretty and tragic
I'll try to keep the walls from falling down
You can be beautiful and fabulous
I'll try to keep the walls from falling down
I can't reach the pain you feel
But I'll try to keep the walls from falling down
If you can hold on
Lose your fear
I'll try to keep the walls from falling down
Falling down

To let you know you're not alone
To bring you peace
Help me be your friend your confidante

Less Than Strangers,"You and me
Had some history
Had a semblance of honesty
All that has changed now
We shared words
Only lover speak
How can it be
We are less than strangers

Oh it hurts to lose in love
Let anger and cruelty win
It’s unfair that you doubt your feelings
And that you’ll ever love again
I know that hearts can change
Like the seasons and the wind
But when I said forever
I thought that we’d always be friends

You and me had some history
Had a semblance of honesty
All that has changed now
We shared words
Only lovers speak
How can it be
We are less than strangers

I thought I saw you yesterday
I thought I passed you on the street
I swear I saw your face
I was not imagining
That you stole a glance my way
You walked away from me
My heart it may be broken
But my eyes are dry to see

You and me had some history
Had a semblance of honesty
All that has changed now
We shared words
Only lovers speak
How can it be
We are less than strangers",Tracy Chapman,Pop
Let It Rain,"Let it rain
As I walk these streets unknown
To no one named
Not even myself
When I'm low

Give me hope
That help is coming
When I need it most
Give me hope
That help is coming
When I need it most

Let it go
No mother no father no home
Forget as all others
Have forgotten
When I'm alone

But give me hope
That help is coming
When I need it most
Give me hope
That help is coming
When I need it most

Let it come
Love that lifts me up
Pain that brings me down
Everything I'd ever want and don't
When I'm not strong

But give me hope
That help is coming
When I need it most
Give me hope
That help is coming
When I need it most

Let it rain
Let it flood these streets and wash me away
To where it makes no difference who I am
Or what the future holds
When I don't know

But give me hope
That help is coming
When I need it most
Give me hope
That help is coming
When I need it most",Tracy Chapman,Pop
Love's Proof,"I want you
Try to forget her
In your heart
You know that she'll never
Love you love you love you

I want you
Try to forget her
She won't call
Or write you a letter
Of love love love's proof

I want you
Try to forget her
Give her time
And you'll wait forever
For love love love's proof

It's not in the stars
It's all in the proof
The chances the odds
The one you love will love
And fall for you
And fall for you

I want you
Try to forget her
You think she's good
I'll be better
And love you love you love you

Material World,"You in your fancy
Material world
Don't see the links of chain
Binding blood


Our own ancestors
Are hungry ghosts
Closets so full of bones
They won't close


Call it upward mobility
But you've been sold down the river
Just another form of slavery
And the whole man-made white world
Is your master


You in your fancy
Material world
Create in your own image
A supreme god


Your virgin mary
Your holy ghosts
Claimed to be pure of heart
Have hands that are stained with blood


You in your fancy
Material world
Don't see the links of chain

Never Yours,"NEVER YOURS

Say I have known some
Less than I should
Say I have known some
Too well for my own good
Say I'm a saint of mercy
Say I'm a whore
I've been a lot of things
But never yours

I wear my mama's dress
Her finest clothes
Daddy showed me outside
To meet you on the front porch
I laugh at all your jokes
But you look bored
I've been a lot of things but never yours

You never cross my mind
You can be sure
You'll never catch my eye
Waiting for you watching the door
I let you hold me
Dry lip kiss me on the dance hall floor
I've been a lot of things
But never yours

Never yours
Never yours
Never yours
Never yours
Never yours
Never yours
Never yours
Never yours

So you say you won
It was a bet
A game of pool or cards
I repay my family's debt
I let you lie beside me
With no remorse
I've been a lot of things
But never yours

Say I have known some
Less than I should
Say I have known some
Too well for my own good
Say I'm a saint of mercy
Say I'm a whore
I've been a lot of things
But never yours

New Beginning,"The whole world's broke and it ain't worth fixing
It's time to start all over make a new beginning
There's too much pain too much suffering
Let's resolve to start all over make a new beginning
Now don't get me wrong I love life and living
But when you wake up and look around at everything
that's going down
All wrong
You see we need to change it now this world with too few happy endings
We can resolve to start all over make a new beginning
Start all over
Start all over
Start all over
Start all over

The world is broken into fragments and pieces
That once were joined together in a unified whole
But now too many stand alone - There's too much
separation
We can resolve to come together in the new beginning

Start all over
Start all over
Start all over
Start all over

We can break the cycle - We can break the chain
We can start all over - In the new beginning
We can learn, we can teach
We can share the myths the dream the prayer
The notion that we can do better
Change our lives and paths
Create a new world and

Start all over
Start all over
Start all over
Start all over

The whole world's broke and it ain't worth fixing
It's time to start all over, make a new beginning
There's too much fighting, too little understanding
It's time to stop and start all over
Make a new beginning

Start all over
Start all over
Start all over
Start all over

We need to make new symbols
Make new signs
Make a new language
With these we'll define the world

And start all over

Nothing Yet,"Good times and bad
Seen them both
Hope fly out the window
Fortune walk through the door
Learned not to believe
This is as good as it gets
Because we ain't seen nothing yet

Hands untied
But the same shuffle once again
Running all the time
Ain't going nowhere
It's a new page in the same book
It's a new game with the same rules
The lights go down
Fade to black on the set
And we ain't seen nothing yet

Saddled with bonds
Broken and in disrepair
Forty acres to a forty-ounce
Don't seem fair
The sirens rise and wail
Shadowed by Liberty's torch
As the boats that brought us over
Are slowly sinking off the shore
And we ain't seen nothing yet

This life a crime
A blessing and a curse
Chosen and unwanted
Displaced and usurped
I'd run away
But there is nowhere to go
So I'll stand and fight
And hope and pray
That the best is yet to come
And we ain't seen nothing yet",Tracy Chapman,Pop
Oh Holy Night,"Oh, Holy Night

And error pining

It's worth a thrill of hope
The weary world rejoices
For yonder breaks a new
And glorious morn

Our Bright Future,"To my father
What of your sons?
All
Of your children

Sent out
To martyr
To face the gun
Precious bodies
Opposed to bombs

Where
Our bright future

To take the path
Where
Our bright future

To the children
Born innocent
But come to harm
For dreams of glory
And just a line
In history

Led on led on
To take the path
Where
Our bright future
Is in our past

To our father
What good may come?
To let the children
Walk alone
To fear to fail
And need no savior
To be at peace
In our true nature

Our bright future
May come to pass

Over In Love,"Cold wind blows
Shivers loose
Hard rain
To my skin soaked through

So over in love with you
I don't even care

Sky turns grey
Black and blue
Fall on me
I can't be moved

So over in love with you
I don't even care

Hot sun shines
And lays bare
Shadows cross cut
Heavy air

So over in love with you
I don't even care

The tide that washes in and out
Reveals a heart
And face worn new

So over in love with you

Paper And Ink,"Touched the mirror
Broke the surface of the water
Saw my true self
All illusions shattered

Money's only paper only ink
We'll destroy ourselves if we can't agree
How the world turns
Who made the sun
Who owns the sea
The world we know will fall piece by piece

Sat down up close to the colored black hole
Like they'd always told me not to
Saw the one dimension polka dot pacifier
And all illusions shattered

Money's only paper only ink
We'll destroy ourselves if we can't agree
How the world turns
Who made the sun
Who owns the sea
The world we know will fall piece by piece

Bared myself wholly heart and body unadorned
Stripped down solely
To the evil and the good
Felt no shame
Naked to the world
And all illusions shattered

Money's only paper only ink
We'll destroy ourselves if we can't agree
How the world turns
Who made the sun
Who owns the sea
The world we know will fall piece by piece

Faced towards the sea
Looked to heaven up above
Felt the world revolve around me
No one could tell me otherwise
But the turbulent waters won't reflect this life
Only the sun the moon and sky
And all illusions shattered

Money's only paper only ink
We'll destroy ourselves if we can't agree
How the world turns
Who made the sun
Who owns the sea
The world we know will fall piece by piece

Remember The Tinman,"There are locks on the doors
And chains stretched across all the entries to the inside
There's a gate and a fence
And bars to protect from only God knows what lurks outside
Who stole your heart left you with a space
That no one and nothing can fill
Who stole your heart who took it away
Knowing that without it you can't live
Who took away the part so essential to the whole
Left you a hollow body
Skin and bone
What robber what thief who stole your heart and the key

Who stole your heart
The smile from your face
The innocence the light from your eyes
Who stole your heart or did you give it away
And if so then when and why
Who took away the part so essential to the whole
Left you a hollow body
Skin and bone
What robber what thief
Who stole your heart and the key

Now all sentiment is gone
Now you have no trust in no one

Who stole your heart
Did you know but forget the method and moment in time
Was it a trickster using mirrors and sleight of hand
A strong elixir or a potion that you drank
Who hurt your heart
Bruised it in a place
That no one and nothing can heal

You've gone to wizards, princes and magic men
You've gone to witches, the good the bad the indifferent
But still all sentiment is gone
But still you have no trust in no one

If you can tear down the walls
Throw your armor away remove all roadblocks barricades
If you can forget there are bandits and dragons to slay
And don't forget that you defend an empty space
And remember the tinman
Found he had what he thought he lacked
Remember the tinman
Go find your hear and take it back

Who stole your heart
Maybe no one can say
One day you will find it I pray",Tracy Chapman,Pop

She's Got Her Ticket,"She's got her ticket
I think she gonna use it
I think she going to fly away

Up

Why not leave why not
Go away
Too much hatred
Corruption and greed
Give your life
And invariably they leave you with
Nothing

Young girl ain't got no chances
No roots to keep her strong
She's shed all pretenses
That someday she'll belong
Some folks call her a runaway
A failure in the race
But she knows where her ticket takes her
She will find her place in the sun

And she'll fly, fly, fly...

Smoke And Ashes,"I'd heard rumors and I'd heard talk
About the trail you'd left of broken hearts
About the sea of tears too wide to cross
But a little bad press has never scared me off
So I burned a path to figure out
How to get me some of what you got
I've got a red hot heart
If the talk is true your's is the same
And we should be together
And let our passions fan love's flame

When I looked for you I almost passed you by
You were so cool and calm I thought my friends had lied
But I thought so much reserve must make you wild inside
It was there and then that I knew I had to get some of what you got

I've got a red hot heart
If the talk is true your's is the same
And we should be together
And let our passions fan love's flame

I thought I'd won your heart when I held you hand in mine
I thought it was true love the way we complemented each other
But my right is your wrong
And when you're right then I'm left with nothing
Your light and your heat have all been spent
Leaving only smoke and ashes
Only smoke and ashes baby

I've got a red hot heart
Any your heart's as blue as the blood in your veins
I say there's fire down below
You say it's only smoke and ashes baby

I'm crying all the time
Salty stinging tears
And mourning for the past carbon-dated years
But knowing now for certain that you were always right
Because if a breeze could blow you out of my life
It's only smoke and ashes baby
Only smoke and ashes baby

I've got a red hot heart
And your heart's as blue as the blood in your veins
I say there's fire down below
You say it's only smoke and ashes baby

I was blinded by devotion
My unwavering love for you
So blinded that I thought all your lies were true
But now I know for certain since you've gone away
It was just a smoldering fire I mistook for a blaze
Only smoke and ashes baby

I've got a red hot heart
And your heart's as blue as the blood in your veins
I say there's fire down below

So,"So you make a little money
Off of somebody else's sweat
So some people starve a little
While you get fat
While you get fat

So you grind and grind
And you push and shove
And claim that those most worthy
Will get what they deserve
What they deserve

It can't be true
It can't be true
Because I've seen too many hungry faces
I've seen too many with the likes of you
It can't be true

You give nothing away for free
If silence were truly golden
I guess no one could sleep
No one could sleep

You have money at your fingertips
People at your beck and call
And you're fool enough
To think for a price
You can have the whole wide world

For all our sake's
And all our lives
We must hope the words
That come from your lips
We must hope those words are lies

For all our sake's
And all our lives
We must hope the dreams
Soulless visions that you have
Are never realized

So
You've got a big house
And you drive a fancy car
So what if your pockets are full
If you have an empty heart

You snap your fingers
And all the waters part
So what if the people bow down
If they show you no regard

Your left hand
Always watches your right
So what if you trust in God
If you can't sleep at night

You think you've made it
You think you've got what everyone wants
So what if you're a big fat man
With an empty little heart

Who has made a little money
Off of somebody else's sweat
Who watched the people starve

While you got fat

Something to See,"No war no greed

And have the courage of heart and mind
To right what is wrong

What you're told
You can't believe what you hear
The speeches of the politicians
Ring untrue and insincere
You can't believe what you read

But do not count the dead
They do not count the dead

In the face of freedom

Subcity,"People say it doesn’t exist

Off the waste and decay
Off the discards of their fellow man
Here in subcity life is hard
We can’t receive any government relief
I’d like to please give mr president my honest regards
For disregarding me

They say there’s too much crime in these city streets
My sentiments exactly
Government and big business hold the purse strings
When I worked I worked in the factories
I’m at the mercy of the world
I guess I’m lucky to be alive

They say we’ve fallen through the cracks
They say the system works
But we won’t let it
Help
I guess they never stop to think
We might not just want handouts
But a way to make an honest living
Living this ain’t living

What did I do deserve this
Had my trust in god
Worked everyday of my life
Thought I had some guarantees
That’s what I thought
At least that’s what I thought

Last night I had another restless sleep
Wondering what tomorrow might bring
Last night I dreamed
A cold blue light was shining down on me
I screamed myself awake

Tell It Like It Is,"Say it say it say it Tell it like it is

What makes you want to breakdown and cry
But say you'll never turn your back

And tell it like it is

Say it say it say it
So no one can forget
Say it say it say it Tell it like it is
What breaks your heart
What keeps you awake at night
What makes you want to break the ties that silence and bind
And tell it like it is
Say you'll never cover your ears and close your mouth
And live in a silent world
Say you'll only run as far or as fast as you need to be secure
Say that then you'll tell the truth
When a lie could cross your lips
And tell it like it is

Telling Stories,"There is fiction in the space between
The lines on your page of memories
Write it down but it doesn't mean
You're not just telling stories

There is fiction in the space between
You and reality
You will do and say anything
To make your everyday life seem less mundane
There is fiction in the space between
You and me

There's a science fiction in the space between
You and me
A fabrication of a grand scheme
Where I am the scary monster
I eat the city and as I leave the scene
In my spaceship I am laughing
In your remembrance of your bad dream
There's no one but you standing

Leave the pity and the blame
For the ones who do not speak
You write the words to get respect and compassion
And for posterity
You write the words and make believe
There is truth in the space between

There is fiction in the space between
You and everybody
Give us all what we need
Give us one more sad sordid story
But in the fiction of the space between
Sometimes a lie is the best thing
Sometimes a lie is the best thing",Tracy Chapman,Pop
The First Person on Earth,"From the water
From the rock
And the dirt
You were
The first person
On Earth

Oh the mountains

Wiynessed
Your birth
The first person
On Earth

By a river
On the banks
Of a sandy shore
Untouched clean
Fresh and pure

To see the good
In the world
Before the pain
And the scourge

In the calm
Before
The storm

The dream
For a love
That never dies
In a poem
The first person
On Earth

And I'm in love
With you
I'm in love
With a dream
That can not be
Realized
Held or seen
By
The last person
On Earth

After
The earthquakes
The hurricanes
The fires
And floods
I'm
Jaded cynical
Angry and glum
The worlds
Too absurd
And obscene
For true love
And more
Than happy
To let me become
The last person
On Earth

To let me stand
On a rock
The Muddy Waters
Surround
Abandoned alone
The end
Soon to come
As the last person
On Earth

As
The waters rise
At the end
Of the world
Thought I bear
The weight
Of the rock
And the dirt
I know
I'm worthy
Of your love

The last person

The Love That You Had,"The love that you had
In your heart is gone
Any touch of sincerity
Any trace of compassion

What hardened your heart?
What turned it to stone?
What made you forget?
You were in love with someone

Your hands don't reach out
Your voice doesn't call me
I know you've stopped listening
Your eyes look straight through me

If nights are like this
I'd rather be alone
Who said you could forget
You were in love with someone?

Tell me what hardened your heart
Tell me what turned it to stone
Tell me what made you forget
You were in love with someone

Was I wrong to forgive
Your indiscretions?
Should I have been more hysterical
Less understanding?

If you're looking for a villain
Go on assume the role
But don't say that it's my fault
That you're not in love with someone

Tell me what hardened your heart
Tell me what turned it to stone
Tell me what made you forget
You were in love with someone

Tell me there's someone in your life
I'll fight to keep your for my own
Tell me because I really want to know
Why you can't be in love with someone",Tracy Chapman,Pop
The Only One,"She was the only one
Of my flesh and blood
Now I have no calling
I can do no worldly good

I sit silent

I sit listless all the day
I've mostly lost the voice to speak
And any words to say except
Does heaven have enough angels yet?

I've gone hard
And I've gone cold
I can't make the piece of this cracked life fit
Please forgive me for wanting to know
Does heaven have enough angels yet?

She was the only one
Of my own flesh and blood
Sometimes I hear her calling
Straight from the house of god",Tracy Chapman,Pop

This the most heinous of crimes
This the deadliest of sins
The greatest violation of all time

You've heard of bombs exploded underground

Hotter than ever before

A queen
With cities of concrete and steel
But there is no glory no honor
In what results

We all are witness
To the rape of the world

She has been clear-cut
She has been dumped on
She has been poisoned and beaten up
And we have been witness
To the rape of the world
Mother of us all
Place of our birth
How can we stand aside
And watch the rape of the world

If you look you'll see it with your own eyes
If you listen you will hear her cries
If you care you will stand and testify

Thinking Of You,"I used to think
About what's real and true
What can not be proven
What can be assumed
Once when I was younger
In the bloom of youth
I received an honest answer
When a lie would do

Chorus:
And now all I do is sit
In my darkened room
And on accasion break my silence
To howl at the moon
To curse every nerve
And neuron in my brain
That won't stop the pain I'm feeling
And let me stop thinking

I used to think
Galileo would agree
That the world was round
And you'd come round to me
But I have looked for you
And you're nowhere in sight
The world must be flat
The Babylonians were right

[Chorus]

I used to think
Consider gravity
If I placed you on a pedestal
You'd slip and fall for me
But you floated on the air
Far away at light speed
I guess some objects do defy
The laws that we conceive

[Chorus]

I used to think
It took all my time
Analysing you
Your mind on my mind
Your name my mantra
Repeated on my lips
That once tried to kiss you
A memory unrepressed

[Chorus]

Stop thinking of you
Stop thinking of you
Stop thinking of you",Tracy Chapman,Pop
This Time,"This time
I wont show I'm vulnerable
This time

This time
I will not be hurt

I'm gonna love myself
More than anyone else
I'm gonna treat me right
I'm gonna make you say
That you love me first
And you'll be the one
with the most to lose tonight

This time
I'm gonna keep my heart locked safe inside
This time
I'm gonna be the one
To win your love
your affection
To hide my fear of rejection

Unsung Psalm,"There would be psalms sung by a choir
I would have a white robe a halo newly acquired
I'd be at peace and I'd have no desire
If I'd lived right

There would be cherubs with tiny harps arrows and bows
I'd have a halo and a flowing white robe
I'd be enfolded by a celestial light
If I'd lived right

But I'm feeling hot and bothered under the collar
I feel the sweat breaking out on my brow
I feel the heat and I know it's the passion
The love I can't disavow

If this is a dream wake me up now
If this is a movie let's edit these scenes out
It would be a PG instead of an X-rated life
If I'd lived right

Some would call me a cheat call me a liar
Say that I've been defeated by the basest desires
Yes I have strayed and succumbed to my vices
But I tried to live right

But I have no regrets no guilts in my heart
I only feel sadness for any pain that I've caused
I guess I wouldn't bother to worry at all
If I'd lived right

Do you live by the book do you play by the rules?
Do you care what is thought by others about you?
If this day is all that is promised to you
Do you live for the future the present the past?

If there is one thing I know I know I will die
If anyone cares some stranger may critique my life
I may be revered or defamed and decried
But I tried to live right

There would be psalms sung by a choir
I would have a white robe a halo newly acquired
I'd be at peace and I'd have no desire
If I'd lived right",Tracy Chapman,Pop
Wedding Song,"I've been having dreams and visions

Right beside me

outstretched towards me

For you I don the veil
By your light
Others pale by comparison
I place my faith in love
My fate in this communion

I've been having dreams and visions
In them you are always standing
Right beside me
I reach out for your hand
To see your arms extending
Outstretched towards me

To you I give my pledge
I honor all that's good
In this life we're living
To think not only of myself
But of the greater union

Can I get a witness
There is salvation and rapture for the lonely
Can I get a witness
Bless this day sacred and holy

I've been having dreams and visions
In them you are always standing
Right beside me

To see your arms extending
Outstretched towards me

All my shame all my faults and virtues
Behold body mind and spirit
Heart and soul devoted all to you

Written by Thom Bell and Phil Hurtt.


This, is our fork in the road
Love's last episode
There's nowhere to go, oh no

You made your choice, now it's up to me
To bow out gracefully
Though you hold the key, but baby

Whenever you call me, I'll be there
Whenever you want me, I'll be there
Whenever you need me, I'll be there
I'll be around

I, knew just what to say
Now I found out today
That all the words had slipped away, but I know

There's always a chance
A tiny spark remains, yeah
And sparks turn into flames
And love can burn once again, but I know you know

Whenever you call me, I'll be there
Whenever you want me, I'll be there
Whenever you need me, I'll be there
I'll be around...yeah

Whenever you call me, I'll be there
Whenever you want me, I'll be there
Even if I have to call, I'll be there
I'll be around

Just call me at home, I'll be there
I'll never leave you alone, I'll be there
Just call out your name you know I know you know
I'll be around

They take my mind

Of who we wish our loves could be

Axis: Bold As Love,"Axis: Bold As Love
Written by Jimi Hendrix

Anger, he smiles,
towering in shiny metallic purple armour
Queen Jealousy, envy waits behind him
Her fiery green gown sneers at the grassy ground

Blue are the life-giving waters taken for granted,
They quietly understand
Once happy turquoise armies lay opposite ready,
But wonder why the fight is on

But they're bold as love, just as bold as love
Yeah, they're bold as love
Just ask the axis

My red is so confident that he flashes trophies of war,
and ribbons of euphoria
Orange is young and full of daring,
But very unsteady for the first go round
My yellow in this case is not so mellow
In fact I'm trying to say it's frigthened like me
And all these emotions of mine keep holding me from
Giving my life to a rainbow like you

I'm as bold as love, I'm as bold as love
Just as bold as love
Just ask the axis

Baby Is A Butterfly,"There's a mansion on the moon
Honey we will be there soon
Into ships our dreams are tossed
Hold my hand and let's get lost

Baby Is a Butterfly
Silken wings and eagle eye
Watch her running up the sky
Oh Baby…is a butterfly

Rivers never stop to rest
Sparrows know that they are blessed
(going forth into the night
Beckoned by the city lights)

Baby Is a Butterfly
See her swimming in the sky
Hurts me so to hear her cry
Oh baby…is a butterfly

Staying all day at the fair
Evening primrose in her hair
Everything's a miracle
Now my cup is always full

Baby Is a Butterfly
Silken skin and eagle eye
We'll be angels by and by
Baby…is a butterfly

Stars are hiding in the clouds
Branches gonna catch them now",Joan Osborne,Pop
Baby Love,"Tender as a peach
someone I would love to teach
Started as a joke
just a lazy little poke
Woke up one sweet day
and I could not run away
Ears will start to bleed
No I cannot take this speed

(chorus)
I'm in baby love
I'm in baby love
I'm in baby love again

I was innocent
wonder where your manners went
How was I to know
it would never let me go
Drag it through the mud
will we ever see some blood
You would try to leave
something I can not conceive

(Chorus)
I'm in baby love
I'm in baby love
I'm in baby love again

Take me in your fist
prove to me that you exist
Be as plain as day
watch my body melt away
There in black and white
victim of my appetite
Make me understand
do you want to be the man?

(chorus)
I'm in baby love
I'm in baby love
I'm in baby love again

Billie Listens (To Your Heartbeat),"Comin' out of the window
Watchin' down from the wall
Billie listens to your heartbeat
Floatin' down the hall
You think my eyes are covered over
You think my heart has crawled away
Billie listens to your heartbeat
When I don't know what to say
I meant to be your drivin' wheel
I meant to be your swing
If I had a tongue like that
I would keep you safe
I would keep you safe from everything
I made a deal with the ocean
I made a deal with the ground
Billie listins to your heartbeat
When I'm not around
When I'm not around

Boy Dontcha Know,"She sees them out on the street in the mornin'
The hard legs in the slim headwalk
When they look down, there's no blood in the water
And people listen to them when they talk

She'd rather be a boy, dontcha know?
She'd rather be a boy, dontcha know?
She'd rather be a boy, dontcha know?
She'd rather be a boy, dontcha know?

She'd like to get something off her chest
She knows that time isn't on her side
They told her she gets to have it all
A pretty story but she knows they lied, lied

She'd rather be a boy, dontcha know?
She'd rather be a boy, dontcha know?
She'd rather be a boy, dontcha know?
She'd rather be a boy, dontcha know?

Just as the ghost of Miss Monroe
Be the best in the world and have nothin' to show
Be a meal for the wolves or a rich man's prize
Peak around that door, see their hunger in their eyes
Well, it comes as no surprise

And when she's lookin' good, so good, mighty good
She feels a target on her back
And if she doesn't try to soothe your ego
She stands accused of a mood so black, so black

She'd rather be a boy, dontcha know?
She'd rather be a boy, dontcha know?
She'd rather be a boy, dontcha know?
She'd rather be a boy, dontcha know?
She'd much rather be a boy, dontcha know?
Oh yes, she'd rather be a boy, dontcha know?
Well, she'd rather be a boy, dontcha know?
Oh, she'd much rather be a boy, dontcha know
Dontcha know, dontcha know?

(Boy, dontcha know
Boy, dontcha know
Boy, dontcha know
Boy, dontcha know)

Well, she'd rather be a
She'd rather, she'd rather
She'd rather, she'd rather
She'd rather be a little boy, dontcha know?

She'd rather, she'd rather

A brick house
The lady's stacked and that's a fact
I ain't holding nothing back

She's a brick house

A woman needs to get a man
How can she lose when she is
36-24-36, what a winning hand

She's a brick house
She's the one, the only one
Built like an Amazon

The clothes she wears, the sexy ways
Make the old man wish for younger days
She knows she's built and knows how to please
Sure enough to knock a strong man to his knees

Shake it down, shake it down now

She's a brick house
She mighty, mighty, mighty just lettin' it all hang out
A brick house
We're put together everybody knows
And here's how the story goes

Shake it down, shake it down now

Brokedown Palace,"Fare you well, my honey, fare you well my only true one.
All the birds that were singing are flown, except you alone.

Going to leave this brokedown palace,
On my hand and knees, I will roll, roll, roll.
Make myself a bed in the waterside,
In my time, In my time ,I will roll, roll roll.

In a bed, in a bed, by the waterside I will lay my head.
Listen to the river sing sweet songs, to rock my soul.

River going to take me, sing sweet and sleepy,
Sing me sweet and sleepy all the way back home.
Its a far gone lullaby, sung many years ago.
Mama, mama many worlds Ive come since I first left home.

Goin home, goin home, by the waterside I will rest my bones,
Listen to the river sing sweet songs, to rock my soul.

Going to plant a weeping willow,
On the banks green edge it will grow, grow, grow.
Sing a lullaby beside the water,
Lovers come and go, the river roll, roll, roll.

Fare you well, fare you well, I love you more than words can tell,
Listen to the river sing sweet songs, to rock my soul.",Joan Osborne,Pop

Cathedrals,"In the shadows
of tall buildings
of fallen angels
on the ceilings
Oily feathers
and bronzen concrete
faded colors
pieces left incomplete
The light moves slowly
past the electric fence
across the borders
between continents

In the Cathedrals
of New York and Rome
there is a feeling
that you should just go Home
and spend the lifetime
finding out just where that is

In the shadows
of tall buildings
the architecture
is slowly peeling
Marble statues
and glass dividers
someone is watching
all of the outsiders
The line moves slowly
through the numbered gate
past the mosaic
of the Head of State

In the Cathedrals
of New York and Rome
there is a feeling
that you should just go Home
and spend the lifetime
finding out just where that is

In the shadows
of tall buildings
of open arches
and lessly knealing
Sonic landscapes
echoing vistas
someone is listening
from a safe distance
The line moves slowly
into the fading light
a final moment
in the dead of night

In the Cathedrals
of New York and Rome
there is a feeling
that you should just go Home
and spend the lifetime
finding out just where that is

Cherry Tree Carol,"When Joseph was an old man, an old man was he
He married Virgin Mary, the Queen of Galilee
He married Virgin Mary, the Queen of Galilee

Mary and Joseph walked through an orchard green
There were berries and cherries, as thick as might be seen
There were berries and cherries, as thick as might be seen

When Mary said to Joseph, so meek and so mild
Joseph, gather me some cherries, for I am with child
Joseph, gather me some cherries, for I am with child

Then Joseph flew in anger, in anger flew he
Let the father of the baby gather cherries for thee!
Let the father of the baby gather cherries for thee!

Then up spoke baby Jesus, from in Mary's womb
Bend down the tallest tree, that my mother might have some
Bend down the tallest tree, that my mother might have some

Then bend down the tallest branch, it touched Mary's hand
Cried she, oh look thou Joseph, I have cherries by command
Oh look thou Joseph, I have cherries by command",Joan Osborne,Pop

"Christmas, Must Be Tonight","Come down to the manger, see the little stranger
Wrapped in swaddling clothes, the prince of peace
Wheels start turning, torches start burning
Behold wise men journey from the East

How a little baby boy bringing people so much joy
Son of a carpenter, Mary carried the light
This must be Christmas, must be tonight

A shepherd on a hillside, while over my flock I bide
On a cold winter night a band of angels sing
In a dream I heard a voice saying ""fear not, come rejoice
It's the end of the beginning, praise the new born king""

How a little baby boy bringing people so much joy
Son of a carpenter, Mary carried the light
This must be Christmas, must be tonight

I saw it with my own eyes, written up in the skies
But why a simple herdsmen such as I
And then it came to pass, he was born at last
Right below the star that shines on high

Ain't you heard a word I've said
Get up Jack
Get up Jack, read the news
See if you can tie your shoes
Find another friend to use
Get up Jack

And come down, come down
Long enough to see my face
Come down, come down
Get up Jack, run and hide
Tell us all how hard you tried
Burn your bridges, drown your pride
Get up Jack
Get up Jack, crack your head
Been so long since I fed
You ain't heard a word I've said
Get up Jack
REPEAT CHORUS
If I came in a bottle...
It was a mighty good year
How come I don't get you high
How come you're still here
God, you were so beautiful
I used to watch you sleep
God, God so beautiful
Too much promise to keep
Get up Jack, go to hell
Baby I can taste the smell
Wish I didn't, truth to tell
Know you, know you so damn well

Grand Illusion,"The obliteration of your isolation
the complete explosion
of you fondest notion
This disintegration
is your elevation
It's a grand illusion, it's a grand illusion

You're crying,you're trying so hard now
You'll be laughing
a hundred thousand years
There is only one day
and tonight is the night
It's a grand illusion

The devastation of your separation,
the disillusion of
your constitution,
It's exhilaration,it's your liberation

You're crying,you're trying so hard now
You'll be laughing a hundred

Great Day In December,"It was on a cold December day
When Joseph carried a baby away
To a place for the savior to be born, oh
He couldn't find no place to rest
She bore, yes she did, she bore the pain
A little child, oh Jesus, truly had to be born

I heard him say: there ain't no room at the inn
No room at the inn, there ain't no room at the inn
There ain't no room at the inn, there ain't no room at the inn
For your child (room at the inn)
To be born (room at the inn)
Ohh (room at the inn)
You know we traveled through the night
Storm and rain, oh yes it was
The little child, oh Jesus, truly had to be born

Joseph he trembled all through the night
Nobody but Joseph and his little darlin' wife
I said, there were three, three wise men comin' from afar
Bible tells me they were guided by the stars
Till they fell down to worship this holy one

I heard them say 'there ain't no room at the inn'
No room at the inn, there ain't no room at the inn
There ain't no room at the inn, there ain't no room at the inn
For your child (room at the inn)
To be born (room at the inn)
Ohh (room at the inn)
You know we traveled through the night
Storm and rain, oh yes it was
The little child, oh Jesus, truly had to be born

You know I heard them say 'there ain't no room at the inn'
No room at the inn, there ain't no room at the inn
There ain't no room at the inn, there ain't no room at the inn
For your child (room at the inn)
To be born (room at the inn)
Ohh (room at the inn)

Storm and rain, oh yes it was
The little child, oh Jesus, truly had to be born

Hands Off,"They made you clean and shiny
They stuffed your pockets full of cash
They gave you 99 servants
To carry out your trash
But your soul is showing
I can see right through

Do you like the chase?
Are you aching for a pretty palm
To leave a mark on your face?
But the women don't like you
No matter what you do
Hands off of things
That don't belong to you

Well the devil's on the riser
He's got the microphone
He's an old scandalizer
He smells the meat on the bone
Do you ever miss the days when
You were young and true?
Hands off of things

Well the guns are firing
And the children fall
And the world is crying
For the waste of it all
Your crimes are bloody
And you know it's true
Hands off of things

Hands off of the fathers
Hands off of the mothers
Hands off of the sisters
Hands off of the brothers
Hands off of the oceans
Hands off of the sky

Heart Of Stone,"Leanin' against the window of a white hotel room
Lookin' down at Dallas, shining in the heat
Honey when you move it's graceful as a pnther
Open up your lips and my heart skips a beat

You suffer so pretty like a ragged apostle
You burn oh so brightly like a soldering gun
And I gave my body and soul to relieve you
But now you have told me that I'm not the one

And if I'm not the one
Baby if I'm not the one

Who's gonna dive down to the floor of the ocean
Who's gonna save you from being alone
Who's gonna hold you when you cry in the nighttime
Who's gonna carry your heart
Your heart of stone

I believed my love
Could chase away your darkness
Was strong enough to fight all the demons in your dreams
(Little did I know the weight would pull me under
Living in your world is so much harder than it seems)

Bit if I'm not the one
Baby if I'm not the one

Who's gonna dive down to the floor of the ocean
Who's gonna save you from being alone
Who's gonna hold you when you cry in the nighttime
Who's gonna carry your heart
Your heart of stone

Heat Wave,"Whenever I'm with him
Something inside
Starts to burnin'
And I'm filled with desire

Could it be the devil in me
Or is this the way love's supposed to be

Just like a heatwave
Burning in my heart
Can't keep from cryin'
It's tearing me apart

Whenever he calls my name
So slow, sweet and plain
I feel, yeah, yeah,
Well I feel that burning flame

Has my blood pressure got a hold on me
Or is this the way love's supposed to be

Just like a heatwave
Burning in my heart
Can't keep from cryin'
It's tearing me apart

Sometimes I stare in space
Tears all over my face
I can't explain it, don't understand it
I ain't never felt like this before

But that doesn't mean it has me amazed
I don't know what to do, my head's in a haze

Just like a heatwave
Yeah yeah yeah....

Holy Waters,"On a pitch black highway lookin’ for a road
Sleepin’ on a stormy bed, honey, who will be your coat
Came to be my drivin’ wheel, you came to be my man
Now you’re rollin’ like a baby boy in the backseat of a van

Holy waters, holy way
Holy waters, sweetest way

Mississippi and Missouri
Where the sun swims with the moon
Rainbows run through chapel rooms
Pourin’ honey by the spoon
In came to bring you watermelon
Bring you scented wine
Now I’m burning up in hot breath
And the rivers rollin’ out of time

Holy waters, holy way
Holy waters, sweetest way

I listen to a seashell out on a purple shore
I heard a song so wild and sweet it moved me to the core
So while the road is dancin’ you let your love know how
Move it like the ocean and the waves from here tonight

How Sweet It Is,"How Sweet It Is (To Be Loved By You)""
by Joan Osborne

How sweet it is to be loved by you
How sweet it is to be loved by you

I needed the shelter of someone's arms and there you
were
I needed someone to understand my ups and downs and
there you were
With sweet love and devotion
Deeply touching my emotion
I want to stop and thank you baby
I just want to stop and thank you baby

How sweet it is to be loved by you
How sweet it is to be loved by you

I close my eyes at night
Wondering where would I be without you in my life
Everything I did was just a bore
Everywhere I went it seems I'd been there before
But you brighten up for me all of my days
With a love so sweet in so many ways
I want to stop and thank you baby
I just want to stop and thank you baby

How sweet it is to be loved by you
How sweet it is to be loved by you

You were better for me than I was for myself
For me, there's you and there ain't nobody else
I want to stop and thank you baby
I just want to stop and thank you baby

How sweet it is to be loved by you
How sweet it is to be loved by you",Joan Osborne,Pop

in three dimensions
Come in here, you can never return

Like a hurricane
in the face of the wind and the rain
like a hurricane
when you open you open a vein

I see your headlights across my ceiling
you are a puppet of a wish I made
They never touch me, they say I'm crazy,
I was born from my mother's brain,
my mother's brain

(chorus)
Like a hurricane
in the face of the wind and the rain

when you open you open a vein
You plant a seed in my mind

I walk around and I speak your message
For myself I don't know what to say
I walk around and I speak your message

If you think I'm not awake
I know what's goin' on
You've been lying to me
But I don't want to set you free
I know what's goin' on

I'm the one who makes you happy,
You got to know that for sure
(can't we give our love just one more try
Make it better than it was before)

Did you try to resist
Was she longing to be kissed
I know what's going on
Does she whisper does she sing
Does she say you're everything
I know what's going on

I will wait for this to end
Cause I know you'll need a friend
When at last she breaks your heart
Cause the only way to win
Is to get you back again
Until then I'll fall apart

I know what's going on

I'm Just A Bill,"GIRL: Whew! You sure gotta climb a lot of steps to get to this Capitol Building here in Washington! But I wonder who that sad little scrap of paper is?

I'm just a bill
Yes, I'm only a bill
And I'm sitting here on Capitol Hill
Well, it's a long, long journey
To the capitol city
It's a long, long wait
While I'm sitting in committee
But I know I'll be a law someday
At least I hope and pray that I will
But today I am still just a bill

GIRL: Gee, Bill, you certainly have a lot of patience and courage!

BILL: Well I got this far. When I started, I wasn't even a bill. I was just an idea. Some folks back home decided they wanted a law passed, so they called their local congressman and he said, 'You're right, there oughta be a law.' Then he sat down and wrote me out and introduced me t Congress, and I became a bill. And I'll remain a bill until they decide to make me a law.

I'm just a bill
Yes I'm only a bill
And I got as far as Capitol Hill
Well, now I'm stuck in committee
And I'll sit here and wait
While a few key congressmen discuss and debate
Whether they should let me be a law
How I hope and pray that they will
But today I am still just a bill

GIRL: Listen to those congressmen arguing! Is all that discussion and debate about you?

BILL: Yeah, I'm one of the lucky ones. Most bills never even get this far. I hope they decide to report on my favorably, otherwise I may die.

GIRL: Die!

BILL: Yeah, die in committee. Ooh! But it looks like I'm gonna live! Now I got the House of Representatives and they vote on me.

GIRL: If they vote yes, what happens?

BILL: Then I got the Senate and the whole thing starts all over again.

GIRL: Oh no!

BILL: Oh yes!

I'm just a bill
Yes, I'm only a bill
And if they vote for me on Capitol Hill
Well, then I'm off to the White House
Where I'll wait in a line
With a lot of other bills
For the President to sign
And he signs me then I'll be a law
How I hope and pray that he will
But today I am still just a bill

GIRL: You mean even if the whole Congress says you should be a law, the President can still say no?

BILL: Yes, that's called a veto. If the President vetoes me, I have to go back to Congress, and they vote on me again, and by that time you're so old...

GIRL: By that time, it's very unlikely that you become a law. It's not easy to become a law, is it?

BILL: No!

But how I hope and pray that I will
But today I am still just a bill

CONGRESSMAN: He signed you, Bill! Now you're a law!

But when it comes without a warning
what are you gonna do
this time?You gonna do this time?

come rushing through my mind
Branded with thoughts of you
they're tattooed on my soul

Tracing our steps from the beginning
Until they vanished into the air
Trying to understand
How our lives has lead us there

There was nobody I'd ever known
Such an empty surprise to feel so alone
Now for me some words come easy
But I know that they don't mean that much
Compared with the things
That are said when lovers touch

You never knew what I loved in you
I don't know what you loved in me
Maybe the picture of somebody
You were hoping I might be
Awake again I can't pretend
And I know I'm alone and close to the end
Of the feeling we've known

How long have I been sleeping
How long have I been drifting
Alone through the night
How long have I've dreaming
I could make it right
If I closed my eyes
And tried with all my might
To be the one you need

Awake again I can't pretend
And I know I'm alone and close to the end
Of the feeling we've known
How long I've been sleeping
How long have I been drifting
Alone through the night
How long have I been running

Don't delay
Hate's goin' round
Bring it down a little love is very peaceful
So bring it down a little
Just give the world LOVE

Lumina,"chorus:
Lumina
Come and wrap around me
Lumina
Take me through the snow

Eve take a train, Eve took a train
Went to see her man
Melting inside, melting away
Like butter in the pan

(chorus)

Eve took a fruit, Eve bit the fruit
Just ran down her chin
Babies will put things in their mouths
Never heard of sin

Lumina
Open like the sea
Lumina
sing me in the dark

Eve had to ask, Eve had to ask
What is wrong with this?
Here is the place, now is the time
Let's invent the kiss

(chorus)

Come and wrap around me...

Make You Feel My Love,"When the rain is blowing on your face
and the whole world is on your case
I could offer you a warm embrace
to make you feel my love

When the evening shatters
and the stars appear
and there is no one there
to dry your tears
I could hold you for a million years
to make you feel my love

I know you haven't made your mind up yet,
but I would never do you wrong
I've known it from the moment that we met,
no doubt in my mind where you belong

I'd go hungry, I'd go black and blue
I'd go crawling down the avenue
No there's nothing that I wouldn't do
to make you feel my love

The storms are raging on the the rolling sea
and on the highway of regret
The winds of change are blowing
wild and free
you ain't seen nothing like me yet

I could make you happy,
make your dreams come true
There is nothing that I wouldn't do
Go to the ends of the earth for you
to make you feel my love

Man In The Long Black Coat,"Crickets are chirping
The water is high
There’s a soft cotton dress on the line
Hang dry
The window’s wide open
African trees
Bent over backwards
In a hurricane breeze

Not a word of goodbye
Not even a note
She’s gone with the man in the
Long black coat

Somebody seen him
Hangin’ around
At the old dance hall
On the outskirts of town
He looked into her eyes
When she stopped him to ask
If he wanted to dance
He had a face like a mask
Somebody said
From the bible he quote
There was dust on the man in the
Long black coat
Preacher was talking
There’s a sermon he gave
Said every man’s conscience
Is vile and deprave
You can not depend on it
To be your guide
When it’s you
Who must keep it satisfied

It ain’t easy to swallow
It sticks in the throat
She gave her heart to the man in the
Long black coat

One, two
There are no mistakes in life
Some people say
It’s true sometimes
You can see it that way
People don’t live or die
People just float
She gave her heart to the man in the
Long black coat

There’s smoke on the water
It’s been there since June
Tree trunks uprooted
In the high crescent moon
Hear the pulse
And vibration
And the rumblin’ force
Somebody’s out there
Beating on a dead horse

She never said nothin’
There was nothin’ she wrote
She’s gone with the man in the
Long black coat
She’s gone with the man in the
Long black coat
She’s gone
She’s gone
Gone with the man in the
Long black coat
Gone with the man in the
Long black coat

Match Burn Twice,"Early in the morning when I'm still in bed
I start thinking 'bout last night
My imagination gets the best of me
And I can feel the match burn twice
Baby have I told you that I love your way
Only once will never suffice
They say that love is always sweeter the second time around
And I can feel the match burn twice
BRIDGE
Oh I take my time, time, time
Oh I must confess
Oh here comes the part I like the best
So even when you're miles and miles away from me
Baby it's no sacrifice
They say that love is always sweeter the second time around
And I can feel the match burn twice
REPEAT BRIDGE
So even if you're never comin' back no more
Baby it's no sacrifice
They say that love is always sweeter the second time around
And I can feel the match burn twice

Meat and Potatoes,"Here she come with meat and potatoes
Come and get your plate piled high
Dish you up some fried green tomatoes
She got all you need to survive

Feed you like your momma used to
Spread your blanket down on the ground
Dip your biscuit all up in the gravy
Pickin' up the scent like a hound

Don't it fill you, don't it fill you
Don't it fill you up?
Don't it fill you, don't it fill you
Don't it fill you up?

Got to have that nice tender brisket
Sweat she got the best in town
Gave it up but lord don't you miss it
Gonna make the sweat run down

What she got got so much flavor
Barbeque or deep fat fried
Once you had it you cannot forget it
You don't need a thing on the side

Don't it fill you, don't it fill you
Don't it fill you up?
Don't it fill you, don't it fill you
Don't it fill you up?

Steam is pouring out of the kitchen
Gonna lick the plate so clean
Just a little sugar in the fatback
You can taste it on your dreams

Here she come with meat and potatoes
Come and get your plate piled high
Dish you up some fried green tomatoes
She got all you need to survive

To survive

Meet You In The Middle,"Though we may fight
Most every night
I'll meet you in the middle some day
The heartaches thrive
But the love survives
I'll meet you in the middle some day

People are known to be reckless
To never let go of their pride
But honey I believe we've been careless
Cause the damage just can't be denied

Oh, before we start
We're miles apart
And there's a million reasons why
But I wake to find
You're still on my mind
It's stronger as the years go by

I'd like to sit down with you darlin'
Show you everything in my heart
But emotions run high when I see your face
I just don't know where to start

Oh, I'll meet you in the middle some day
Oh, I'll meet you in the middle some day

Mm, if all for this
Just one more kiss
I'd travel any distance to find
Your eyes of coal
Your secret soul
I swear that I could read your mind

Honey you can call me crazy
To think that our affection could last
But I see us throw it all together
After all the storms have passed

Oh, though we may fight
Most every night
I'll meet you in the middle some day
The heartaches thrive
But the love survives
I'll meet you in the middle some day

Oh, I'll meet you in the middle some day
Oh, I'll meet you in the middle some day

Midnight Train To Georgia,"L.A. proved too much for the man
So he's leavin' the life he's come to know
He said he's goin' back to find
Ooh, what's left of his world
The world he left behind Not so long ago

He's leaving
On that midnight train to Georgia
And he's goin' back
To a simpler place and time

And I'll be with him
On that midnight train to Georgia
I'd rather live in his world
Than live without him in mine

He kept dreamin'
That someday he'd be a star.
But he sure found out the hard way
That dreams don't always come true.

So he pawned all his hopes
And he even sold his old car
Bought a one way ticket back
To the life he once knew,
Oh yes he did,He said he would

And now he's leavin
On that midnight train to Georgia
He said he's goin' back
To a simpler place and time

I'll be with him
On that midnight train to Georgia
I'd rather live in his world
Than live without him in mine

Mongrels,"Whatever happened to this?
It was an island of bliss
In this ridiculous place
But now the river runs black
And I don't know the way back
I feel it goin' to waste

We are the mongrels
Underneath the table
Fightin' for the leavings
Tearin' them to shreds
We are the mongrels
Rollin' on the floorboards
Unaware of the banquet
Up above our heads

I reach across the divide
I wanna take you inside
But something's holding me down
There is a thorn in my side
It's coming on like a tide
These tender feelings to drown
This is a chance for the prize
It's waiting here in my eyes
You hardly look at me now
With every beat of my heart
I want to make a new start
But I don't seem to know how
We are the mongrels",Joan Osborne,Pop

Never Get Tired (Of Loving You),"If the truth should turn to fiction
If the desert should fill with snow
If the earth should cease to spinnin'
There is somethin' I want you to know

Well the clouds may hide the mountains
And the rivers may run in the street
And the ones who were our heroes
May go down in bitter defeat

But I will never get tired of loving you
I will never get tired of loving you
I will never get tired of loving you
I will never get tired of loving you

Well I may have to surrender
Every dollar I ever earned
And I may wind up forgettin'
Every lesson I ever learned

If the devil climbs up to heaven
If the birds fall out of the sky
If the days get trapped in the nighttime
If we got no more tears to cry

But I will never get tired of loving you
I will never get tired of loving you
I will never get tired of loving you
I will never get tired of loving you

Well I saw you in a vision
And I chose you out of grace
By the light of your imagination
I saw the wonderment of your face

If you should lose all remembrance of me baby
And call me by another's name
If you should close your door and lock me out
I'm forever gonna feel the same

But I will never get tired of loving you
I will never get tired of loving you
I will never get tired of loving you
I will never get tired of loving you",Joan Osborne,Pop

Performed by Joan Osborne

Only you know and I know
All the loving we've got to show
So don't refuse to believe it
By reading too many meanings

'Cause you know that I mean what I say so don't go
And never take me the wrong way
You know you can't go on getting your own way
'Cause if you do, it's gonna get you someday, yeah.

We're both here to be pleasing
Oh no, not deceiving
But it's hard to believe in, aw yeah
When you've been so mistreated.

'Cause you know that I mean what I say so don't go
And never take me the wrong way
You know you can't go on getting your own way
'Cause if you do, it's gonna get you someday.

If I seem to mislead you
It's just my craziness coming through
But when it comes down to just two
Aw, I ain't no crazier than you

'Cause you know that I mean what I say so don't go
And never take me the wrong way
You know you can't go on getting your own way
'Cause if you do, it's gonna get you someday.

Pensacola,"Well, I found him in Pensacola
In a trailer in the sand
The man from the picture
Creased and yellowed in my hand
Creased and yellowed in my hand

He was squinting and stubbled
And standing in the door
He said, if you've come to take the car away
I don't have it anymore
I don't have it anymore

He got the gospel on the radio
And the gospel on tv
He got all of the transcripts
Back to 1963
Back to 1963

He said I sold my blood for money
There wasn't any pain
But I just can't stand the feeling
It's in someone else's veins
It's in someone else's veins

Momma took me aside
And she tried to change my mind
She said, don't waste your time in looking
There's nothing, nothing left to find
Nothing, nothing left to find

So I left him down in Pensacola
In a trailer in the sand
The man from the picture
Creased and yellowed in my hand
Creased and yellowed in my hand

Please Don’t Tell Me How The Story Ends,"This may be our last good night together
We may never pass this way again
Just let me enjoy it ‘til it’s over, for forever
Please don’t tell me how the story ends

See the way our shadows come together
Softer than your fingers on my skin
Someday this may be all we remember of each other
Please don’ tell me how the story ends

Never’s just the echo of forever
Lonesome as the love that might have been
Let me go on loving and believing ‘til it’s over
Please don’t tell me how the story ends",Joan Osborne,Pop
Poison Apples (Hallelujah),"Your memory comes back to me

see God would never be so cruel
to make me like without your face

it does you good to see me fall
like poison apples from the tree

I gave you away so easily
it makes me wounder why

Moving throught you every night
the lovely girls in dresses tight
The angels dancing on a pin
the people we are downing in
Like a needle going in
Oh I recall the moment when
you ruined me for other men

I gave you away so easily
it makes me wonder why
I don't know why

And I lay mine out in the neon light
It’s ragged and it’s worn but it’s about to be reborn
Honey, are you gonna take me home tonight?

I look him deeply in the eye
Will it be a sweet old friend
Or a pretty little stranger passin’ by?

I wonder who will the next fool be

Righteous Love,"I was a troubled soul
I had a worried mind
Drifting from place to place
I was the restless kind.
Right there in front to me
bright as the light of day
you saw a broken girl
You loved me anyway

And if I sprouted wings
I would not be amazed
cause Faith is a mystery that
rocks me for days and days and days
and
I could be in the street
I could be on a train
or stuck in some doorway down
in the pouring rain
Now there is not one place
that doesn't feel like home
No matter where I go
I know I'm not alone

I've never been so sure of love

And if I sprouted wings
I would not be amazed
cause faith is a mystery that
rocks me for days and days and days
Oh you can ask me once
And I will tell you twice
No one's convincing me
this isn't paradise
And if I cause you pain
I'd only hurt myself
cause we have a righteour love
I feel for no one else

And in big wads of money,

And no one will ever
get near me again.
There is safety in numbers,

There are people who watch you
in your windows at night.
And they follow your movements
in the cold fluorescent light.
They wait for their moment,
they'll get you in the end.
There is safety in numbers

I was just like you before --
You want somebody to love.
Since that day I learned the score --
I know how to rise above.

There is shelter in power
and promises of pain.
And in lovers and lawyers
and dogs pulling at the chain.
And no one will ever
get near me again.
There is safety in numbers,
in numbers, my friend.

You will find me well protected
when you come around today.
So remember what I told you
and continue on your way.
'Cause no one will ever
get near me again.

Fire of this pleasure, it can warm me
But in the end it only burns
He could put me high on a pedestal
He could rob me of my shame
He could hold me down under water
Till I could not remember my own name

In my hands, the hammer and the nail
Gonna send my wishes up to Glory
Gonna shake that devil off my trail

In my time I’ve done some meanness
Brought the ones I love so much pain
Pride, it was eatin’ all my heart away
My soul it was rustin’ in the rain
And all these sins I am confessin’
They still come knockin’ on my door
But I know better than to answer
I tell them that girl don’t live here anymore

In my mind, I see the house I’m buildin’
In my hands, the hammer and the nail
Gonna send my wishes up to Glory
Gonna shake that devil off my trail

Every livin’ thing is callin’ out to me
The leaves on the trees wave me on
Got a wind to lift me when I’m fallin’
Got a road to put my feet upon

In my mind, I see the house I’m buildin’
In my hands, the hammer and the nail
Gonna send my wishes up to Glory
Gonna shake that devil off my trail

Smiling Faces Sometimes,"Smiling Faces Sometimes
by Joan Osborne

Smiling faces sometimes pretend to be your friend
Smiling faces show no traces of the evil that lurks within
Smiling faces, smiling faces sometimes
They don't tell the truth, huh
Smiling faces, smiling faces
Tell lies and I got proof

The truth is in the eyes
Cause the eyes don't lie, amen
Remember a smile is just
A frown turned upside down
My friend let me tell you
Smiling faces, smiling faces sometimes
They don't tell the truth, huh
Smiling faces, smiling faces
Tell lies and I got proof
Beware, beware of the handshake
That hides the snake
I'm telling you beware
Beware of the pat on the back
It just might hold you back
Jealousy (Jealousy)
Misery (Misery)
Envy

I tell you, you can't see behind smiling faces
Smiling faces sometimes they don't tell the truth
Smiling faces, smiling faces
Tell lies and I got proof
Smiling faces, smiling faces sometimes
They don't tell the truth
Smiling faces, smiling faces
Tell lies and I got proof
(Smiling faces, smiling faces sometimes)(2 x's)
I'm telling you beware, beware of the handshake
That hides the snake

Listen to me now, beware
Beware of that pat on the back
It just might hold you back

They don't tell the truth
Smiling faces, smiling faces
Tell lies and I got proof

Your enemy won't do you no harm
Cause you'll know where he's coming from
Don't let the handshake and the smile fool ya
Take my advice I'm only try' to school ya

Son Of A Preacher Man,"Billy-Ray was a Preacher's son
And when his daddy would visit he'd come along
When they gathered round and started talking
Cousin Billy would take me walking
Through the back yard we'd go walking
Then he'd look into my eyes
Lord knows to my suprise

Chorus:
The only boy who could ever reach me
Was the son of a preacher man
The only boy who could ever teach me
Was the son of a preacher man
He was, yes he was, oh yes he was

Being good isn't always easy
No matter how hard I tried
When he started sweet talking to me
He'd come and tell me everything is alright
He'd kiss and tell me everything is alright
Can I get away again tonight

Chorus

How well I remember
The look that was in his eyes
Stealing kisses from me on the sly
Taking time to make time
Telling me that he's all mine
Learning from each others knowing
Looking to see how much we'd grown

The only boy who could ever move me
Was the son of a preacher man
The only boy who could ever groom me
Was the son of a preacher man
He was, yes he was, oh yes he was

Spider Web,"I dreamed about Ray Charles last night
And he could see just fine

Dreamed about Ray Charles last night
And he could see just fine, you know
I asked him for a lullaby
He said, ""Honey, I don't sing no more""
No more, no more, no more
Ray don't sing no more

He said, ""Since I got my eyesight back,
my voice has just deserted me.
No 'Georgia On My Mind' no more...
I stay in bed with MTV.""

Then Ray took his glasses off
And I could look inside his head
Flashing like a thunderstorm
I saw a shining spider web

Spider web (repeat 3x)
In Ray Charles' head

I dreamed about Ray Charles last night
He took me flying in the air
Showed my own spider webs
Said, ""Honey, you had best take care.
The world is made of spider webs
The threads are stuck to me and you
Be careful what you're wishing for
'Cause when you gain you just might lose""
You just might lose your...

Spider web (repeat 3x)
What Ray Charles said

When you're feelin' lonely
When you're hidin' in your bed
Don't forget your string of pearls
Don't forget your spider web

When I go to sleep tonight
Don't let me dream of brother Ray
No, no, no, don't...
Don't get me wrong, I'm glad he sees
Just like him best the other way

Spider web (repeat 3x)
What Ray Charles said...
In Ray Charles head

All I got's my spider web
Keepin' me alive

Till I reach the other side

You keep slipping back across my mind
Did we maybe leave a love behind
Afraid of what we felt

Other loves I’ve had have come and gone

There are questions that go on and on but
Time won’t tell

Time won’t tell me how it might have been
And time won’t make what’s wrong alright
It can only take me back again
And re-run all those memories in black and white

I watch us kiss goodbye that day
Here’s where you turned around and walked away
What were the words that would have made you stay
But, time won’t tell

I have visions of many things
Love's happiness is just an illusion
Filled with sadness and confusion,
What becomes of the broken hearted

I know I've got to find
Some kind of peace of mind
Maybe.

The fruits of love grow all around
But for me they come a tumblin' down.
Every day heartaches grow a little stronger
I can't stand this pain much longer
I walk in shadows
Searching for light
Cold and alone
No comfort in sight,
Hoping and praying for someone to care
Always moving and goin to where
What becomes of the broken hearted
Who had love that's now departed?
I know I've got to find
Some kind of peace of mind
Maybe.

I'm searching though I don't succeed,
But someone look, there's a growing need.
Oh, he is lost, there's no place for beginning,
All that's left is an unhappy ending.
Now what's become of the broken-hearted
Who had love that's now departed?
I know I've got to find
Some kind of peace of mind
I'll be searching everywhere
Just to find someone to care.

I'll be looking everyday
I know I'm gonna find a way
Nothings gonna stop me now
I'll find a way somehow

When The Blue Hour Comes,"The good times are all gone
The night keeps coming on so strong
You cant hold on, no matter what you do
Will there be someone who cares for you
When the blue hour comes?
When the blue hour comes?

And when your restless heart
Tears your world apart
And everywhere you turn
Its falling down on you
Will there be a light that shines for you?

When the blue hour comes for you
If theres anything that you would have me do
Just call on me and Ill be coming through
I will always be there for you
When the blue hour comes
When the blue hour comes

Good times dont last forever
Sometimes its now or never
Darling, reach out for me
You know where Ill be
I will always be there for you
When the blue hour comes
When the blue hour comes for you
If theres anything that you would have me do
Just call on me and Ill be coming through
I will always be there for you

Where We Start,"Lookin' at your childhood face
On the pillow where you lie
Maybe when a good thing's gone
One is born before our eyes
Standin' here alone in this room with you
All you were before and all you will be, too
Penetrates my lonely, lonely heart
Oh, baby, baby, baby, baby, this is where we start

Waking to this dream of life
Honey, there's no cause to hide
Risin' like a breath of ease
All the world is on our side
All alone in this room with you
All the things you are and all you will be, too
Penetrates, devastates my lonely heart
Oh, baby, baby, baby, baby, this is where we start
Oh, baby, baby, baby, baby, this is where we start

Hand me down my dancing shoes
Hand me down my silver wings
Take me out to town tonight, yes
So I can hear my angels sing
Lying here with you, I raise my eyes
And I pray that time, time, will pass us by
To remain inside the beating of you heart
Oh, baby, baby, baby, baby, this is where we start
Oh, baby, baby, baby, baby, this is where we start
Oh, baby, baby, baby, baby, this is where we start",Joan Osborne,Pop
Who Divided,"I get into my car
Turn the radio on
Drive by your house, your window, your bed
Since we’ve been over and done
Ah, but your voice is still ringin’ in my head

Who divided up the days into hours
The hours into minutes
How could they really be that smart?
Who divided up the minutes into seconds?
They must’ve had a broken heart
Must’ve had a broken heart

I saw you way up town
Another girl by your side
I knew by your smile she was more than just a friend
I’m gonna bury my head in the comfort so deeper
Knowin’ I’ll never feel your arms again

Who divided up the days into hours
The hours into minutes
How could they really be that smart?
Who divided up the minutes into seconds?
They must’ve had a broken heart
Must’ve had a broken heart

It’s when love is over you’re gonna learn about time
You’re gonna fight and scheme
You’re gonna weep and moan
You’re gonna wonder why, why, why, why

It’s 3 AM says the clock on the wall
Here is the dark of the night the world stands still
I’m reaching for the phone, that old number to call
Oh, but I know I can’t stand to feel that chill

Who divided up the days into hours
The hours into minutes
How could they really be that smart?
Who divided up the minutes into seconds?
They must’ve had a broken heart
Must’ve had a broken heart

Who divided up the days into hours
The hours into minutes
How could they really be that smart?
Who divided up the minutes into seconds?
They must’ve had a broken heart
Must’ve had a broken heart

Who divided up the days into hours
The hours into minutes
How could they really be that smart?

Wild World,"How will we stay on the sidewalk
When there is no gravity
Piece of paper floating upward
But no one stops to see
And you think that I'm the right one
'Cause I know just what to say
And you ask me to convince you
That you won't blow away
In this wild wild world
Wild, wild world
By the river
Well we made them to be broken
Sorry if they let you down
Sorry if the ones you know
Are vanishing all over town
And I need someone to hold me
And I ask you to be fair
And you'd like to give me something
But we both know there ain't a lot
Ain't a lot to spare
In this wild, wild world
Wild, wild world
Oh are you listening
To make sure I'm still here?
Oh did you know
That the river burns like gasoline
And they can't turn on the rain machine
And they tell me there is no more space
Won't you turn around
'Cause I hate it when I cannot see your face
In this wild, wild world
In this wild, wild world
Wild, wild world

Scared Of Happy,"It's been a while since I was lost for words
Needles and static and stutters
I never knew a love that doesn't hurt

Something about your feeling
Pushing and pulling me in
And now my walls fall down

No one to blame but yourself
I take a step back and I breathe for once
This is what I want

Something about your feeling
Pushing and pulling me in
That's why I come back for more

Knows everybody's disapproval
I should've worshipped her sooner
If the heavens ever did speak
She is the last true mouthpiece

A fresh poison each week

""We were born sick""

Command me to be well
Amen, amen, amen

Take me to church
I'll worship like a dog at the shrine of your lies
I'll tell you my sins
So you can sharpen your knife
Offer me that deathless death
Good God, let me give you my life

If I'm a pagan of the good times
My lover's the sunlight
To keep the goddess on my side
She demands a sacrifice
That looks tasty
That looks plenty
This is hungry work

I'll tell you my sins
So you can sharpen your knife
Offer me my deathless death

Nothing you can say but you can learn how to play the game

There's nothing you can make that can't be made
No one you can save that can't be saved
Nothing you can do but you can learn how to be you in time
It's easy

All you need is love
All you need is love
All you need is love, love
Love is all you need

Love, love, love
Love, love, love

All you need is love
All you need is love
All you need is love, love
Love is all you need

There's nothing you can know that isn't known
Nothing you can see that isn't shown
No where you can be that isn't where you're meant to be

American,"Play house,
Put my favourite record on
Get down,
Get your crystal method on
You were like tall,tan, driving ?round the city
Flirtin' with the girls like you're so pretty
Springsteen is the king don't ya think
I was like 'hell yeah that guy can sing'
Like ooh ooh ooh
Ooh ooh

You make me crazy, you make me wild
Just like a baby, spin me round like a child
Your skin so gold and brown
Be young be dope be proud
Like an american
Drive fast, I can almost taste it now

L.a, I don't even have to fake it now
You were like so sick, everybody said it
You were way ahead of the trend, get get it
Elvis is the best, hell yes
Honey put on that party dress
Like ooh ooh ooh
Ooh ooh

You make me crazy, you make me wild
Just like a baby, spin me round like a child
Your skin so gold and brown
Be young be dope be proud

Everybody wants to go fast
But they can't compare
I don't really want the rest

Only you can take me there
I don't even know what I'm saying
But I'm praying for you

Angel / Down (VMA 2017 Medley),"Who said I was an angel?

We was just a moment, nothing serious
Never really paid it no mind
Drop the back side and paying attention (Shakin' all that)
Should've never not kept your word
Woulda had a reason to keep mine
You was too inconsistent (Shakin' all that)

Should've never crossed that line with ya
Everything was cool, just drinkin' with ya
Way too young to be up in handcuffs
Wasn't tryna spend my life on the phone with ya
Gotta keep it on 100 with ya
The original me wouldn't f*** with ya
And I was beginning to f*** with ya

Who said I was an angel?

I need somebody with some patience
'Cause you know I got a temperament
And yeah, you got a reputation
Nothin' that a little love can't fix
There ain't no kinda situation
Where I wouldn't cross a line for you
Fbi interrogation
I would get up there and lie for you

When push come to shove
You show me love
When push come to shove, aye

Long as you're holding me down, down, down
I'm gon' keep lovin' you down, down, down
Long as you're holding me down, down, down
I'm gon' keep lovin' you down, down, down
I'm gon' keep lovin' you

You the type that I could bake for
'Cause baby, you know how to take that cake
And I'm the only one you wait for
'Cause baby, you know that I'm worth the wait

When push come to shove
You show me love
When push come to shove, aye

Long as you're holding me down, down, down
I'm gon' keep lovin' you down, down, down
Long as you're holding me down, down, down

It's just like Bonnie and Clyde just walked in
A gangster and his bride just walked in
We on the same team and we ballin'
Got me showin' off my ring like I'm Jordan
And I'ma hold you down like you hold me
And I'll never tell a soul what you told me
When I was sittin' in the cells is when you showed me
It takes a real one to put up with the old me
That's why you in the coupe with the low seat
That's why we at the game on the floor seats
My diamond that they seein' from the nosebleeds
You make 'em mad, feel like you won a trophy

Long as you're holding me down, down, down

Long as you're holding me down, down, down

Coming Home,"(Carly Rose Sonenclar)
I'm coming home
I'm coming home
Tell the world that 'i'm coming home
Let the rain wash away
All the pain of yesterday
I know my kingdom awaits
And they've forgiven my mistakes
I'm coming home
I'm coming home
Tell the world that 'i'm coming...

(Tate Stevens)
And the past will dry
Underneath my nails
And the wind will rise
Up to fill my sails
So you can doubt
And you can hate
But I know
No matter what it takes

(Fifth Harmony)
I'm coming home
I'm coming home
Tell the world that I'm coming home
Let the rain wash away
All the pain of yesterday
I know my kingdom awaits
And they've forgiven my mistakes
I'm coming home
I'm coming home
Tell the world that I'm coming...

(Emblem3)
I hear ""The Tears Of A Clow""
I hate that song
I feel like they talking to me
When it comes on
Another day, another dawn
Another Kesha, nice to meet you
Get the math I'm gone
Cause Kesha tell me right
But if Jay-Z tell me wrong
Another night the inevitible prolongs
Another day, another dawn
So please
Say we play to the place
When rapping wrong
I'm coming home
I'm coming home
Tell the world that I'm coming home
Let the rain wash away
All the pain of yesterday
I know my kingdom awaits
And they've forgiven my mistakes
I'm coming home
I'm coming home
Tell the world that I'm coming...

(Carly Rose Sonenclar)
So finally
Somewhere I belong
But it's always darkest
Before the dawn

I'm coming home
I'm coming home
Tell the world that I'm coming home
Let the rain wash away
All the pain of yesterday
I know my kingdom awaits
And they've forgiven my mistakes
I'm coming home

If you start pointing fingers my way
I just wished you love me, love me, baby
If you can do that then I'll do the same, yeah

We can make it work, baby
We'd be crazy if we don't try
Love and hate is such a thin line

Sit yourself down, cause you know you're gonna stay

You ain't going nowhere
You ain't going nowhere

If you're waiting for me
You're gonna be waiting all night
If you're gonna play games, you're gonna lose
You'll be sorry if you say goodbye
Yeah, I still want you, but I don't need you
You should be happy
I'm still here for you
I don't have to be
You must be blind if you can't see

Where you going, where you tryna go?
Where you going, where you tryna go?

Where you going, where you tryna go?

Now that you're gone
I hold on
To all the laughs we shared
And I'll never forget your smile

The hardest thing to do is say goodbye
Goodbye, goodbye, goodbye, goodbye

That I don't wish you were near
But where ever you are
I'm still holding you right here
Here in my heart

I hope and pray
That I'll see you once again
'Til then I'll be looking forward to that day

Hero,"There's a hero,
If you look inside your heart
You don't have to be afraid of what you are
There's an answer,
If you reach into your soul,
And the sorrow that you know will melt away

And then a hero comes along,
With the strength to carry on,
And you'll finally see the truth,
That a hero lives in you

Oooh
Lord knows, dreams are hard to follow
In time, you'll find the way

And then a hero comes along,
With the strength to carry on,
And you cast your fears aside baby,
And you know you that you can survive
So when you feel like hope is gone,
Look inside you and be strong,
And you'll finally see the truth,
That a hero lives in you",Fifth Harmony,Pop

Whisper words of wisdom:
Let it be

And when the broken hearted people
Living in the world agree
There will be an answer:
Let it be

For though they may be parted there is
Still a chance that they will see
There will be an answer:
Let it be

I wake up to the sound of music
Mother Mary Mother Mary comes to me
Speaking words of wisdom
Let it be

Let it be, let it be
Let it be, let it be
There will be an answer:
Let it be

Let it be, let it be
Let it be, let it be
There will be an answer:
Let it be",Fifth Harmony,Pop

Make Love Commandments,"When I had you I treated you bad
Wrong my dear but since, since you went
Don't you know, I sit around
With my head hanging down
And I wonder who's loving you

Ooh, my first mistake was
I wanted too much time
I had to have him morning, noon and night
If I would of known then
The things that I know now
I might not have lost the time I complain about

Don't waste your time
Fighting blind minded
Thoughts of despair

Hold on to your love
Hold on to your love
Hold on to your love
Hold on to your love

The art of playing games now
Is not the hearts you break
It's bound to good love you make
When it's heart's on fire
Give him love everyday, remember he needs space
Be patient and he'll give his heart to you

Don't waste your time
Fighting blind minded
Thoughts of despair

Hold on to your love
Hold on to your love
Hold on to your love
Hold on to your love

Trust and honesty too
Must be the golden rule
You'll feel the strength of passion in your soul
Burn so deeply within
Ooh, the magic that you share
So sacrifice and show how much you care

Don't waste your time
Fighting blind minded
Thoughts of despair

Hold on to your love
Hold on to your love
Hold on to your love

Hold on
Hold on
Hold on",Fifth Harmony,Pop

Parallel on the other side

And a pocket full of soul
I can tell you there's no place we couldn't go
Just put your hand on the glass

Cause I don't wanna lose you now

The vacancy that sat in my heart
Is a space that now you hold
Show me how to fight for now

Comin' back into you once I figured it out
You were right here all along

Staring back at me

Aren't you somethin', an original
Cause it doesn't seem really as simple
And I can't help but stare, cause
I see truth somewhere in your eyes
I can't ever change without you
You reflect me, I love that about you

Would look at us all the time

Loving him is like driving a new Maserati down a dead end street
Faster than the wind, passionate as sin
Ending so suddenly

Loving him is like trying to change your mind
Once you're already flying through the free fall
Like the colors in autumn, so bright, just before they lose it all

Losing him was blue, like I'd never known
Missing him was dark grey, all alone
Forgetting him was like trying to know somebody
You never met

Touching him was like realizing all you ever wanted
Was right there in front of you
Memorizing him was as easy as knowing all the words
To your old favorite song

Fighting with him was like trying to solve a crossword
And realizing there's no right answer
Regretting him was like wishing
You'd never found out
That love could be that strong

You didn't think that I'd come back
I'd come back swinging
You try to break me but you see

What doesn't kill you makes you stronger
Stand a little taller
Doesn't mean I'm lonely when I'm alone
What doesn't kill you makes a fighter
Footsteps even lighter
Doesn't mean I'm over cause you're gone

What doesn't kill you makes you stronger, stronger
Just me, myself and I
What doesn't kill you makes you stronger
Stand a little taller

First off you should really be ashamed
You won't entice me with that big 'ol chain
Can't have my number put that phone away
Maybe you should just stay in your lane

Well even though you're so damn fine
I know I'm better off without ya
Even if you cross my mind
I will always have to doubt ya

I won't believe a thing you say this time
All them other girls told me

When I Was Your Man (Feat. Boyce Avenue),"Same bed
But it feels Just a little bit bigger now
Our song on the radio
But it don't sound the same
When our friends talk about you
All that it does is just tear me down
Cause my heart breaks a little
When I hear your name

And all just sounds like
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh

Too young, too dumb to realize
You should have bought me flowers
And held my hand
Should've give you all my hours
When I had the chance
Take me to every party
Cause all I wanted to do was dance
Now my baby is dancing,
But she's dancing
With another man

your pride, your ego
your needs and your selfish ways
Caused a good strong woman like me
To walk out your life
Now you never,
Never get to clean up
The mess you made
And it hurts me
Every time I close my eyes

It all just sounds like
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh

Too young, to dumb to realize
You should have bought me flowers
And held my hand
Should've give you all my hours
When I had the chance
Take me to every party
Cause all I wanted to do was dance
Now my baby is dancing,
But she's dancing
With another man

Although it hurts
I'll be the first to say that I was wrong
Oh, I know It's probably much too late
To try and apologize for your mistakes
So I just want you to know

I hope he buys me flowers,
I hope he holds my hand
Gives me all his hours,
When he has the chance
Take you to every party
Cause I remember
How much you loved to dance
Do all the things you should've done
When you were my man

Do all the things you should have done
When you were my man

Do all the things I should have done
When I was your man",Fifth Harmony,Pop

I'm still all alone
How could this be?
You're not here with me

You never said good-bye
Someone tell me why
Did you have to go?
And leave my world so cold?

Every day I sit and ask myself
How did love slip away?

In my ear and says:

That you are not alone
I am here with you
Though you're far away
I am here to stay

You are not alone
I am here with you
Though we're far apart
You're always in my heart

You are not alone

Just the other night
I thought I heard you cry
Asking me to come
And hold you in my arms

I can hear your prayers
Your burdens I will bear
But first I need your hand
Then forever can begin

Every day I sit and ask myself
How did love slip away?
Something whispers
In my ear and says:

But you are not alone
I am here with you
Though you're far away
I am here to stay

You are not alone
I am here with you
Though we're far apart

And I'll come running

Got your lipstick mark still on your coffee cup
Got a fist of pure emotion
Got a head of shattered dreams
Gotta leave it, gotta leave it all behind now

Whatever I said, whatever I did I didn't mean it
I just want you back for good
Whenever I'm wrong just tell me the song and I'll sing it
You'll be right and understood

Unaware but underlined I figured out the story
It wasn't good
But in the corner of my mind I celebrated glory
But that was not to be
In the twist of separation you excelled at being free
Can't you find a little room inside for me

Whatever I said, whatever I did I didn't mean it
I just want you back for good
Whenever I'm wrong just tell me the song and I'll sing it
You'll be right and understood

And we'll be together, this time is forever
We'll be fighting and forever we will be

We will never be uncovered again",Take That,Pop
Never Forget,"We´ve come so far
and we´re reached so high
and we´re looked each day
and night in the eye
and we´re still so young
and we hope for more

We've come a long way
but we´ve not to sure
where we´ve been
We've had success
We've had good times
But remember this

Been on this path of life for so long
Feel I've walked a thousand miles
Sometimes strolled hand in hand with love
Everybody's been there
With danger on my mind I would stand on the line of
hope
I knew I could make it
Once I knew the boundaries I looked into the clouds
and saw
My face in the moonlight
Just then I realised what a fool I could be
Just coz I look so high I don't have to see me
Finding a paradise wasn't easy but still
There's a road going down the other side of this hill

Never forget where you've coming from
Never pretend that it's all real
Someday soon this will all be someone else's dream

Been safe from the arms of disappointment for so long
Feel each day we've come too far
Yet each day seems to make much more
Sure is good to be here
I understand the meaning of ""I can't explain this
feeling""
Now it feels so unreal
At night I see the hand that reminds meof the stand I
make
The fact of reality

(chorus)

We've come so far, and we've reached so high
And we've looked each day and night in the eye
And we're still so young and we hope for more

We're not invincible, we're not invincible - no
We're only people, we're only people
Hey we're not invincible, we're not invincible

And you are my saviour when I fall
And you may not think

When you know down inside that I really do

For the best don't want you resting my bones

And not just watching you

Before we turn to stone

To believe in the night
Want a date to belong

And you're working it out
And you're holding us all
In your hands, don't want you waiting for

Before the tables turn
Before we break it off

For me to show my love
The longer I stayed away for
Hiding from a world I need to hear now
Don't think I'll hear it again
But the nights were always warm with you
Holding you right by my side
But the morning always comes too soon
Before I even close my eyes

CHORUS
All I do each night is pray
Hoping that I'll be a part of you again some day
All I do each night is think
Of all the times i closed the door to keep my love within

If you can't forgive the past
I'll understand that
Can't understand why I did this to you
And all of the days and the nights so I regret it
I never showed you my love

But the nights were always warm with you
Holding you right by my side
But the morning always comes too soon
Before I even close my eyes

REPEAT CHORUS

Surely we must be in sight
Of the dream we long to live
If you stop and close your eyes
You'll picture me inside
I'm so cold and all alone

Straight on back to me

Come on
Time is running out
You and me

If you ever change your mind
If the road ahead becomes too hard to climb
If there\'s something in your heart that tells you to stop
Oh to hold you close tonight
I\'d wait for life.

There\'s a voice shouting inside my head
There\'s a space on your side of the bed
There\'s a hope everytime there\'s a sound
There\'s a silence that\'s playing too loud

I don\'t know how you are
Or how you may be
But I know I love you still.

If I close my eyes
I\'ll dream a little deeper baby

I'm bigger than the night sky
As high as the sun, high as a storm
We are giants, we are giants

There are giants across the water
There are giants heading home
In the middle of the madness
There are giants being born

Of the night when you first stood by my side
Old friends with smiles some are here some are gone
Good memories of our senior high
Looking back we're the only couple still together
Even then I knew this love would be forever, I knew

Coz there's nobody else in this world that could love you
Any more than I do, always here for you
Nobody else in this world could love you more
Nobody could love you any more than I do
I'm still here for you

Our faces show the lines of two young sons
And in their houses there will be pictures
Like the ones of you and me
Hope they can look back and smile just like we have done
Never once have I ever felt the need for another
We were strong and survived the storm in time to discover
To discover one another

So open your mind and start living
We can play a part if we only start believing

As the tear from every cloud begin to fall
For one moment then, we understood it all

Everyone, everyone, every man and every women
We all fall, in the end we're just miracles of matter

Oh the miners were on strike
And my dad had gone away
And the Swiss were riding high up in the charts

Another Crack In My Heart,"I am just one man with his one pair of eyes
I dress in normal clothes and I don't try to disguise
I'm looking out for love however it may seem
I never do return in the always winning team

Maybe I should try to live alone,
Or raise the flag of mercy to unknown
Maybe I should run and hide away
Until another day

Another crack in my heart,
Another picture on the wall
Another way to spend an evening
When there's no one there at all
Another kiss to say goodbye,
Another cross upon a chart
Another suitcase at the door
Another crack in my heart
In my heart

I had my spills and thrills of love
And held it in my hand
I held on tight until it broke
And I crashed to the ground
Love cannot be on my side
It's clearer every dull
That every time I reach for love
It always runs away

Maybe I should try to live alone,
Or raise the flag of mercy to unknown
Maybe I should run and hide away
Until another day

Another crack in my heart,
Another picture on the wall
Another way to spend an evening
When there's no one there at all
Another kiss to say goodbye,
Another cross upon a chart
Another suitcase at the door

I saw his face

he had my eyes (my eyes)

The minute you let her under your skin
Then you begin to make it better

Don't carry the world upon your shoulders
Now you know that's a fool who plays it cool
By making his world a little colder

And nothing heals the pain

Even though I've tried, impossible to hide

Reviving memories of our happy home
No sign of sunlight since you ran away
These rooms get darker now every day

Will you still love me?
Will you still love me?

The consequences of freedom
But now you have what you dreamed
Just understand that things are not as they seem

Eight Letters,"We became the parade on the streets that we once cleaned
Expendable soldiers smiling at anything
Raised on a feeling our lives would have meaning eventually

We were once the answer and then you discover
You’re actually just one thing after another
And what was the question?
And why was the lesson so deafening?

This is all that matters now
And that was all that happened anyhow
You can look back but don’t stare
Maybe I can love you out of there
And when I went away
What I forgot to say
Was all I had to say
Eight letters three words one meaning

And outside forces didn’t make it easy
So I thought I’d go before you leave me
Self preservation was no explanation for anything
Oh but the truth is more than we’ll ever comprehend
I’m just starting to understand my friend
All of that distance
Cos I fell in love with the enemy

But this is all that matters now
And that was all that happened anyhow
You can look back but don’t stare
Maybe I can love you out of there
And when I went away
What I forgot to say
Was all I had to say
Eight letters three words one meaning

And when I went away
What I forgot to say
Was all I had to say
Eight letters three words one meaning

At last we meet on no man’s land
Just footprints in the sand
We meet on no man’s land
At last

And when I went away
What I forgot to say
Was all I had to say

Everlasting,"It started on a Friday night
A million years ago
When the world was cold
We were only satellites
With nowhere left to go
When we settled, oh

Call it gravity
Or is it history
Where'd it go?
Where did you go?

It started on a Friday night
We were runnin' wild
We were flyin' high
Searchin' for the time of our lives
Everywhere we go
But never goin' home

And every tear we ever cried
Keeps the rivers of our lives
Flowin' back to me
(Flowin' back to me)
And every thought we ever had
Every word we ever said
Is comin' back to me
And you know

Baby when the lights go out
We'll be dancin'
Even when the sky falls down
We'll be dancin'
Never runnin' out of time

'Cause we're all stars
When we're dancin'

Baby when the lights go out
We'll be dancin'
Even when the sky falls down
We'll be dancin'
Never runnin' out of time

'Cause we're all stars
When we're dancin'

Drivin' in a foreign town
It throws me every time
Tryin' to read the signs
I wonder what you're thinkin' now
When it's late at night
Do you realize?

That every song that made us cry
Made the voices of our lives
Sing in harmony
(Sing in harmony)
And every thought we ever had
Every word we ever said
Is comin' back to me, oh-oh
And you know

Baby when the lights go out
We'll be dancin'
Even when the sky falls down
We'll be dancin'
Never runnin' out of time

Every Revolution,"I can still believe the sky
Isn't rolling through the night
While I sleep fast like a stone
And the crowd we're standing on
Is what we fix ourselves upon
Go on, you can't change what you know

There were chances left untaken
Lost diversions in the road
And far off islands in the sea
A house of flowers
A chapter and a verse
A sheet of white where we all shared our dreams

And we turn every revolution
Every revolution bringing us symphonies
Take a breath and count our lucky days
Hold me here with every revolution
Pulling together now
There's a brand new life in my soul

Now there's water in the well
And the ring has found a bell
To tell the world we're not alone
From the silent sky a plane arrives
I feel like I've been waiting all my life
To welcome you back home

There's a wave coming in to break
The tension as we crash upon the beach
Up ahead the blanket full of stars
A pencil sketch to lie down underneath

And we turn every revolution
Every revolution bringing us symphonies
Take a breath and count our lucky days
Hold me here with every revolution
Pulling together now
There's a brand new life in my soul

And we turn every revolution
Every revolution bringing us symphonies
Take a breath and count our lucky days
Hold me here with every revolution
Pulling together now
There's a brand new life in my soul",Take That,Pop

If I could find a way of fixing all the things that I broke
Then I would, if I could
And I might understand now I ended outta mind
And I might understand now I ended outta mind

And when we talk can you understand my feelings
And understand it hurts to be without you

Never prepared, never know what's going wrong
I'm losing though I always thought this love was so strong
So alone, so lost in the dark
So sad coz you will always have a place in my heart

Hangin onto your love
Hangin onto your love, I need it

Let's take a walk and reminisce about
The feelings we used to feel
Just say the word and I'll be back for good my baby
I'll be back to give you girl what you deserve

Did I say too much, did I try to rule your life
Did the love we had between us
Miss the road to paradise
Can we try again, can we chance it one more time
Can the ecstacy we found her
Be re-claimed as yours and mine

Happy Now,"I get the feeling that we are being lied to
There’s a surge in my psychosis every turn of the screw
And I’m half awake in paisley print
I can see the world clearly but I have to squint
I am a supersonic specimen
A minor miracle of medicine
I’m at the mercy of unwanted emotions
Where nothing matters
Beneath my thoughts
Beneath my thoughts is where it happens
Super heavy elements
Embrace me
Super heavy elements
Replace me
Was it a positive experiment
To be indefinitely decadent

And they checked my pulse and it gave them hope
That there was no truth to what was wrote
Give me half as much but twice as fast or today
Might slip away

I feel myself falling…I’m feeling happy now
I feel myself falling…I’m feeling happy now
I feel myself falling…I’m feeling happy now
I feel myself falling…I’m feeling happy now, feeling happy now

I’m at the back of the club and so afraid to speak
Cos I’m not like these people and these people are not like me
Super heavy elements
Upgrade me
Supersonic elements
Amaze me
Your opinion is irrelevant
I was built to be magnificent

And they checked my pulse and it gave them hope
That there was no truth to what was wrote
Give me half as much but twice as fast or today
Might slip away

I feel myself falling… I’m feeling happy now
I feel myself falling… I’m feeling happy now
I feel myself falling… I’m feeling happy now
I feel myself falling… I’m feeling happy now, feeling happy now

I haven’t scratched the surface of my desire
In the world of dreams I’m a frequent flyer
Super heavy elements
Embrace me
Super heavy elements

I feel myself falling… I’m feeling happy now
I feel myself falling… I’m feeling happy now
I feel myself falling… I’m feeling happy now
I’m feeling immortal… we'll live forever now.

I seem to keep losing track of time and how long it's been

Been a painful road to a door that's closed
Been a gamble that I knew I couldn't win
Been a lonely conversation to this photograph of you
In the mirror there's a sign I must give in

So I'm not holding back the tears anymore
Tryin' to escape the heartache, tryin' to escape emotion
No I'm not holding back the tears anymore
Yesterday's my memory reminding me of all the time
I depended on you

I used to enjoy spending time on my own here
Watching the jaded people pass
Now here I am sharing their pain and their lonely tears
And walking a road of broken glass

It's a constant fight to get through each day and night
It's a war between the present and the past
And the face that's in your mind every time you close your eyes
What's the reason, what's the answer, how long will this last

So I'm not holding back the tears anymore
Tryin' to escape the heartache, tryin' to escape emotion
No I'm not holding back the tears anymore
Yesterday's my memory reminding me of all the time
I depended on you

At last you find a different road and suddenly you're not alone
A game of love rests upon your mind.......

How can it be
That you love me

Who really want your love and all
How can it be
That you and me
So desperately need each other every day
And what does it mean that you want me
Now it's for real today

All the things you once regret and
never learn to pay the price
Some day the rain will fall within
Remember face it don't give in
And watch the bad times pass you by

There's a girl in Camden Town,
And decision makes her frown
Which dress would she wear today
And which way should she smiles at me?

How did it come to this?
How did it ever come to this?

All this noise and all this lies,
All this talking through the nights,
All this expectation now,
It's making me neurotic,tell me
Have I seen your face before?
Have forgot to say hello!
Thought I'd made it clear now,
That's I've always been a smiler,tell me

Sometimes It's like I'm a world away
Sometimes I feel a world away

Just the other day somebody
Said to me,hey maybe you're also slightly
OCD,a little out of reach my friend
I said,yes that's partly true,
But jokes aside,please stay with me,
It's just my way of compartmentalising
All things I see

I Can Make It,"I'm tired of closing my eyes, to picture you in my mind
It feels so cold to be alone
Not sure where I want to be, so close to finding my dream
We need to hold on to all the times we spoke of love
Now I pray to God above that someday I can find the door
I'm looking for

I can make it, I know I can
I can save this love forever
I can make I know I can
We can make this work together

It's not a lonely men's dream,it's just that now that there's been
A taste of love in my life
That I refuse to return, I've got so much to learn
How can it feels as though I've reached the top of this steep hill
For a moment I was standing still
Now I have the faith I've needed to believe

'Cause you knop what this love means to me
You know how it feels when I can see it in your face
That you're missing me now, you feel I've let you down
You've gotta hold on, you've gota reach out and believe

I can make this world a place for me and you
We can make it, we can make it together

Would you say ""I love you""

That seems so little
For all the things you

You have stolen my heart and soul
You didn't do it on purpose
You were just being yourself
That's why I love you and no one else

I look in to your eyes all the time
Knowing in my heart
I have you as mine

I don't want you to be my possession
You have taught me a lesson
Of what love is, a love
I believe was sent from god above

If you were to take my hand and lead me away
Do you know that I wouldn't stay
Just look inot my eyes and you will know
My love for you will grow

Seems like yesterday I was lost
How I give you my love
No matter the cost
You are my love of all loves

All I hope from you
Just to love me as I love you

When I hold you so very tight
I know I will try with all my might
To keep this love alive
I hope someday you will let me
Hold and keep and make you my wife

If It's Not Love,"Before we say goodnight

Lady tonight I'm gonna take this love to new heights

Do you know what you meant to me?
We used to think we were the bomb
Then someone left a real one
We stayed indoors as the rain come
Back then it made no sense to me
I\'m missing you face, your beautiful face
It\'s funny that I reall they gave us the keys to the cit, but they don\'t fit anything
But I\'m coming away.

I hear you calling
I came back running
Forgot that feeling
Been so log coming
They tried to stop her
She just got stronger
I\'m driving home again
Back down Mancunian Way

I just forgot how it is to feel
To dance and move and keep it real
Been lying down fot ten long years
But I was there and it feels like yesterday
I\'m missing you face, your beautiful face
It\'s funny that I recall you came when I was pretty, but that don\'t work no more
But I\'m coming anyway.

Now I stand here in front of you
I know now what I\'m gonna do
My shoulders low, but my head is high
I\'m gonna bring this town alive
Through this acidic rain
I\'m gonna come back to life again.",Take That,Pop
Never Want To Let You Go,"Lying here beside you, in a cloud of warmth

The chances are you'll be there too some day
We'll never know, let's hope

Once You've Tasted Love,"(Love. Once you've tasted love) x 4

Don't be sold a dream. Remember how the past has been
Don't be led to believe thias one's for you
Calculate your needs. I see there's room to plant your seeds
Don't decide till you see how the others have grown

Once you've tasted love it is just the beggining of a new world
Once you've tasted love there's no way you can give in
Once you've tasted love

Still too early to know. Give them time and they will grow
Don't believe that the first's the one for you
Most will grow to be tall, others will break and fall
Keep your eye on the strongest head of them all

Once you've tasted love it is just the beggining of a new world
Once you've tasted love it is just the beggining
Your head is spinning
Once you've tasted love

Once you've tasted love it is just the beggining of a new world
Once you've tasted love there's no way you can give in
Can't control your mind and your head is still spinning
Once you've tasted love is just the beggining
Once you've tasted love

Once you've tasted love, you know is good
Come taste my love
You know you should

RAP:
Came into my world and the badness dissapeared
Take my hand, don't be afraid, I'm gonna work off all your fears
It feels so nice to be with you. Us two, we feel like a glove
When I see your eyes I realise you too have tasted love

Once you've tasted love, you know it's good
Come taste my love

Never been here before, never wanna see here again

And found greater lust from another
My conscience is keeping me awake and shouting at me all night

So I'll tell her the day after tomorrow, maybe today
So I'll tell her the day after tomorrow, or is that too late

Being loved is a big responsibility
You can never give too much back
You know it's so easy to walk away and leave that little lady flat
My life's feeling crowded with possessions, am I lucky or sad
Is it time to turn away and lose everything I had

Moving in circles, decisions chasing me round and round
Why's life never easy, or do we make it hard for ourselves
And when we find love, we need to look for something new
'Cos when it's all over you always feel the need to be loved

Producing everything for everything to be replaced
And indirty towns we will settle down
Manufacture for the human race

Was the grand designs of other men
And they built those walls for you and me
So don't start thinking we can start again
Start a riot in the streets my friend
Or they'll start pulling us apart again
Cos idle hands make idle men
Don't start thinking with your heart again
Cos idle hands make idle men

When the work is done, the work is done
We'll bebionic and beyond the circuits of our minds
We'll get nothing done under electric sun
Leave the weight of labour far behind

We're the greatest story that was ever told
But we don't know where we're from
And the walls became but a memory
Of the days when all the work begun

So don't start thinking we can start again
Start a riot in the streets my friend
Or they'll start pulling us apart again
Cos idle hands make idle men

Rejoice the day, the day the work is done

Tiny minds and eager hands will try to strike

Today I've Lost You,"Driving home in my car, nearly midnight
Rain on the road in my view
Holding my heart, it’s the first night without you
On my clothes I still smell your perfume

Should have called
When I left you were crying
Is it too late to apologise
From talking to fighting, admitting, denying
To finally saying goodbye

Now I regret every word that was spoken
I said some things you know I didn’t mean
Maybe we’ll turn back the time
Work it out, start anew
Oh maybe today I’ve lost you

I can’t help but think of our last conversation
I close my eyes I can still see your face
I hope what I’m feeling now
You are feeling it too
Oh maybe today I’ve lost you

Driving faster out on this empty road
Being single’s so bad at twenty-three
Looking for signs, asking strangers directions
When the answer’s right in front of me

Strange how a minute can feel like a lifetime
I know what I had now it’s gone
I swallowed my pride coz alone here, I’m dying
And with you is where I belong

For twenty-four hours I’ve been searching for reasons
Reasons why we should be living apart
Hope I’m not too late to come home
Work it out, start anew
Oh maybe today I’ve lost you

When We Were Young,"When we were young the world seemed so old
Careless and cold
We did what we were told in our lives
When we were young

Had the world by the tail
Good would prevail
Starships at sail
And none of us would fail in this life
Not when you're young

We were drawn to whoever could keep us together
And bound by the heavens above
And we tried to survive travelling at the speed of love

(Wo oh oh)
When we were young
When we adored the fabulous
(Wo oh oh)
When we were young
We were foolish and fearless
Never knowing the cost of what we paid
Letting someone else be strong
(Who oh oh)
When we were young

In a moment of grace
A long leap of faith
The still more glorious dawn awaits
My life
I'm here with the lovers (I'm here with the lovers)

And we burned the bridges
We're crossing over
Just to see the firelight
And the innocent are getting over
Being old tonight

(Who oh oh)
When we were young
When everything was what it seemed
(Who oh oh)
When we were young
And every day was how we dreamed
Never knowing the cost of what we paid
Letting someone else be strong
(Who oh oh)
When we were young

And when you look at yourself tonight
Are you someone you recognize?
You can take back what you've given away
But it must be the last time

(Who oh oh)
When we were young
(Who oh oh)
When we were young
When we were young

(Wo oh oh)
When we were young
When we adored the fabulous

Why Can't I Wake Up With You?,"Oh, I can't decide

So dark when you walk from my side

Wonderful World,"What a wonderful world this is

It makes me want to kiss
What a beautiful kiss this is
What a beautiful kiss of life
Just before I die

I've been spending time
I've been losing time

But it was never ours to keep
Time can help you find the ground and knock you off your feet
All those minutes get lost in time
One step forward two steps behind
So before I think myself too deep

What a delicate tale of bliss
That I don't want to miss

On the precipice of the abyss

Wooden Boat,"A little boy me went fishing in a wooden boat
Sitting there for hours in the cold
Patience is a virtue til we die
Then a ripple in the water caught my eye

Sometimes we don't know what we're waiting for
That's the time to be the first one on the dance floor
We go from green to blue to gold to black
Breathe deep, who knows how long this will last

Only was last week I learned to drive
Stole my Mother's keys and drove all night
Christine never showed it's 4am
Started up Mum's car drove home again

Sometimes we don't know what we're waiting for
That's the time to be the first one on the dance floor
We go from green to blue to gold to black
Breathe deep, who knows how long this will last

One year ago I kissed my bride
Now I wait to hear my baby's cry
Woman showed me all that she knew then
To cut himself down man's born again

Sometimes we don't know what we're waiting for

It just don't feel right when you're not around
Supposed to be the happiest time of the year

Wrapped up in my winter coat, walking down the street
Trying not to hide on every couple that I see
The only thing that I got on my list, is you here with me, yeah

I don't wanna tell before Christmas eve
And I got so many presents to send you

Every other holiday, I was by your side
I would give em all away to have a silent night
Sposed to be the jolliest time of the year
But it just ain't for me, no
Carolers are singing I just wanna hold your hand
Not having you here with me is more that I could stand
Hoping that's right, pick me up when I land

I'm so I'm so Becky from the block
Always had a little, but I want a lot
No matter where I go I know where I came from

Yo, first grade, Oak street elementary
A few blocks from the Englewood cemetery
I lived through hard times, according to my memory
Then I learned to rhyme like I'm reading up the dictionary
I still walk to the Kelso Market
Even though I get to walk them red carpets
My family lived in my grampa's garage
So I started working just to help out my pops
It all started when my grandpa crossed over
Now one day I might be a crossover
Right now it's just who is that girl?
But one day Imma be all around the world
I still get grounded, always stay grounded
Still do chores even when I'm on tour
One thing's for sure, Ima always be me
That what's up? Becky, Becky, Becky G

I won't stop till I get to the top
I'm so I'm so Becky from the block

Always had a little, but I want a lot
No matter where I go I know where I came from

You what you know about the in and out lines
And what you know about that 4×5 drive
My life is changing quickly right before my eyes
It hits me every time that I'm on Hollywood divine
If you wanna date me, you gotta ask my Daddy
And my 30 uncles, you can meet them in an alley!
And one day Ima bring home a Grammy
But no matter what I'll be bringing home randies
Donuts,so what,holler when you see me
I'm still the same B, even when I'm on TV
Still rocking Js with my diamonds and pearls
You can take me out the hood, but not the hood out of the girl
Yes I love sushi, love my calamari
But ain't no better chef than my very own mommy
If you can't catch me warming in my barrio
I'm with my litas praying the Rosario

but no I don't know selena
Not a rich kid, but I'm a boss bitch
drive my toyota like it's a bimmer
Carpool on that 405, two brothers and I got one sister
Right next to my dad with his head turned back
shotgun, never touched no trigger
When they see this cover girl, the place get nuts
mothers squirl
I'ma let that line sink in for a minute
while I'm visitin' another world
Blast off, I got a little bit of fuel in my jetpack
Travellin' to the moon when I get back
I'ma give it everything, tell em whenever they ring
That I mean it every time that they said that
Who they think they're talking to?

Garden (unreleased),"Secretly you wanted me to fall in love
But I told you I was coming out of something serious
You keep pushing me, pushing me
pushing me to lie
Never had the time to make up my mind
Telling myself that you're too good to be true
How can someone who hates himself be in love with you
Try fixing you, fixing you, fixing all your flaws
How did I end up with a broken heart

You keep lying to me
and I just wanna believe in something
I wanna hold on to something, oh

If you sent me roses every time
that you have broken my heart
Then I'd have a garden by now
If you sent me flowers
to make up for every hour we lost
Then I'd have a garden by now
I'd have a garden
I'd have a garden
I'd have a garden
I'd have a garden by now

It's hard enough waking up next to who you love
When you know you won't ever be his reciprocal
Try leaving him, leaving him, leaving him alone
But I take him back, but it's getting old

You keep lying to me
and I just wanna believe in something
I wanna hold on to something, oh

If you sent me roses
every time that you have broken my heart

I'd have a garden
I'd have a garden

All this stress on my brain
Got me going insane
If I can count all the lies
I'd have me a bouquet
You stuck me with a thorn
I'm just numb to the pain
Thought about getting high
Just to take it away
Now you're sending me roses
Banging at my door saying
""Baby baby, please open! ""
Nah uh! Yeah
I could probably be a florist
After all the times you messed up
I could probably start a forest

If you sent me roses
every time that you have broken my heart
Then I'd have a garden by now
If you sent me flowers to make up
for every hour we lost
Then I'd have a garden by now

Not Backing Down (Unreleased),"I'm so exposed and I feel him waching me
Each breath I'm taking
Lost in the music
Can you find me babe?
He's tryna prove it

When he moves and I back away
If you want me come and get me
And he follows

He's not backing down (oh whoah)
He's not backing down (oh whoah)
He's not backing down (oh whoah)
He's not backing down (oh whoah)
He's not, he's not, he's not backing down

Each move he's making (he's making)
You're lost in the music
I'm tryna find you babe
So scared to lose him

When I move and you back away
Are we done yet playing these games?
Only we know (oh oh)

I'm not backing down (oh whoah)
I'm not backing down (oh whoah)
I'm not backing down (oh whoah)
(I ain't backing down, backing down baby)
I'm not backing down (oh whoah)
I'm not, I'm not, I'm not backing down
(oh whoah)

Yeah, I guess we're learning the hard way
Love isn't what the cards say
It's only for people dreaming
And movies we see
And God is believing
it's you and me but it's not
And it's hard, and it's good, and it's magic
But we can't be together and that is tragic
And I hate it more than I hate traffic
And thinking about you is such a habit
But I can't change the rythm of my heart
And even if I could
wouldn't know where to start
So I just keep letting you know
I'm still around
Making music and hoping
that you could feel the sound
Making earthquakes
hoping you could feel the ground shake
When the sound fades, we just let it downplay
So this is my confession
If there's something you know
Then I hope you don't keep me guessing
Yeah, 'cause you worth walking the whole world

We're not backing down
(I'm not backing down oh whoah)
We're not backing down (oh whoah)
(I ain't backing down, backing down baby)
We're not backing down (oh whoah)

All the young singers
All the new rappers
It's the first chapter, welcome

Open up your textbook
Page 50
I can see the future
I made history

Started with the guitar
Singing in the kitchen
Mommie yelling at me
I told just listen

Was in trouble so I had to make a smile
Cuz accidently broke my new laptop
Like wooooou, big dummy

She was using curse words and I
Can't repeat'em
But that was what, she first heard
Started believing

She was lookint at me...
Anger went to happy...perfect

That's what my music did
You can never run in it
Put my life on the
Pafes in why I'm doing it

I had to make a song for you
And then my show is sing along with you

The music is...what I need everyday
So let this
Song fade away
When life is getting in the way
No, no

Novacane ooh ooh
Novacane
Ooh baby
Novacane
All the music is my novacane
Ooh baby

My heart's in music
So I'm never dying
Doesn't matter if I barely
Stop trying

Tought myself to sing
Sing along with brandy's
Studied every wrong
Cuz I'm trying win a grammy

I'm getting better
But I always stay humble
And daddy say
Pick it up if I fumble

Rapping's in my blood
I've been doing this forever
Only been around
About a decade... whathever

Age doesn't matter
Lighter do the spotlight
I was made for this
Game no stop lights

Keep going even
If the race's done
I'm writing songs
Till I finally place one

They take the money
Send my family on vacation
I ain't leving whole
Word is wasting

This is just simple
Album coming soon
Teen in the city
Make some room

That was my music
Did you can never run in it
Put my life on the pages
Is why I'm doing it

I had to make a song for you
And then my show is sing along with you

The music is...what I need everyday
So let this
Song fade away
When life is getting in the way

Taken without but I was wrong

Keep on missing every shot you take of my heart
And break it in two
Love is so Stupid

I'm so afraid now to fall for him
This new one is a good guy, (yeah)
I already feel like we're best friends
Why am I not closing my eyes, cuz I feel messed up
From the aftermath
Of what the wrong one did to me, I wish I felt better
All the fear I have I know he's so right for me
Love is so (damn)

Love is so Stupid
Keep on missing every shot you take of my heart
And break it in two
Love is so Stupid

Just the thought about being alone
Another valentine ain't nobody calling my phone, well
I'd rather be with my family and friends
Then let my poor heart get shattered again

Sailing,"Well, it's not far down to paradise
At least it's not for me
And if the wind is right you can sail away
And find tranquility

Oh, the canvas can do miracles
Just you wait and see
Believe me

It's not far to never-never land
No reason to pretend
And if the wind is right you can find the joy
Of innocence again

Oh, the canvas can do miracles
Just you wait and see
Believe me

Sailing takes me away to where I've always heard it could be
Just a dream and the wind to carry me
And soon I will be free

Fantasy, it gets the best of me
When I'm sailing
All caught up in the reverie
Every word is a symphony
Won't you believe me?

Sailing takes me away to where I've always heard it could be
Just a dream and the wind to carry me
And soon I will be free

Well it's not far back to sanity
At least it's not for me
And if the wind is right you can sail away
And find serenity

Oh, the canvas can do miracles
Just you wait and see
Believe me

Sailing takes me away to where I've always heard it could be
Just a dream and the wind to carry me
And soon I will be free",Christopher Cross,Pop
Arthur's Theme (best That You Can Do),"Once in your life you find her
Someone that turns your heart around
And next thing you know you're closing down the town
Wake up and it's still with you
Even though you left her way across town
Wondering to yourself, ""Hey, what've I found?""

When you get caught between the Moon and New York City
I know it's crazy, but it's true
If you get caught between the Moon and New York City
The best that you can do
The best that you can do is fall in love

Arthur he does as he pleases
All of his life, he's mastered choice
Deep in his heart, he's just, he's just a boy
Living his life one day at a time
And showing himself a really good time
Laughing about the way they want him to be

Never Be The Same,"It was good for me
It was good for you
Now nothing either of us can say or do
Can change the way you feel tonight
Sometimes love just slips out of sight

Just one thing before you go
Just one thing that you've got to know
No one will ever touch me that way
The way that you did that very first day

And I'll
Never be the same without you here
I'll live alone
Hide myself behind my tears
And I'll
Never be the same without your love
I'll live alone
Try so hard to rise above

The years go by
There's always someone new
To try and help me forget about you
Time and again it does me no good
Love never feels the way that it should

I loved you then I guess I'll love you forever
And even though I know we could never stay together
I think about how it could have been
If we could just start all over again

And I'll
Never be the same without you here
I'll live alone
Hide myself behind my tears
And I'll
Never be the same without your love
I'll live alone
Try so hard to rise above

It was good for me
It was good for you
Now nothing either of us can say or do
Can change the way you feel today
Sometimes love just slips away

Just one thing before you go
Just one thing that you've got to know
No one will ever touch me that way
The way that you did that very first day

Never be the same without you here
I'll live alone
Hide myself behind my tears

Forever,"Don't explain yourself
Doesn't matter reasons why
I'd just as soon you leave it never said
I'd just as soon you go
I can feel your sympathy
And there's pity in your eyes
Well, do you think you mean so much to me
Do you think I'll die?

Chorus:
Well you go and you play
But don't ever think a minute
That you took my love away
Well I know, I said a lot of things
But forever really means until the day it ends
That's tonight,
It's gonna be tonight

I've been turned around
And unsure of what to do
But like nature's streams that wash away
We must let it through
Now you just can't disguise
There's a hardness in your eyes
And we'll never know how much we had
Until it's far behind

(Chorus)

And I'll remember the days I spent with you
Never to lose (never, never, no)
Never, never, no

(Chorus)

I know you said a lot of things
But forever really means until the day it ends

Alibi,"It's a calm wind blowing on my skin
And I've been dreaming again
Now that we're all here
We can share these notes and all this madness
We can talk of innocence
And of all the things we believe in

Is it an alibi
Is it the reason why
Is it the way we really feel inside
Set it free


The magic of those nights brings me closer to that light
That helps me see the path ahead of me
I can feel that something
A hint of mystery
A trace of dare
To live the truth I hide somewhere


Daybreak
In a place I've known before
Will I find me behind that final door


I can hear the footsteps of the past
I can feel the thunder and it's coming fast
I'm gonna spend some time with the moon
Pour myself a glass of midnight
Keep myself in tune


Is it an alibi
Is it the tears I cry
Is it the way I see it through your eyes


The magic of those nights brings me closer to that light
That helps me see the path ahead of me
I can feel that something
A hint of mystery
A trace of dare
To live the truth I hide somewhere

Ride Like The Wind,"It is the night
My body's weak
I'm on the run
No time to sleep
I've got to ride
Ride like the wind
To be free again

And I've got such a long way to go
To make it to the border of Mexico
So I'll ride like the wind
Ride like the wind

I was born the son of a lawless man
Always spoke my mind with a gun in my hand
Lived nine lives
Gunned down ten
Gonna ride like the wind

And I've got such a long way to go
To make it to the border of Mexico
So I'll ride like the wind
Ride like the wind

Accused and tried and told to hang
I was nowhere in sight when the church bells rang
Never was the kind to do as I was told
Gonna ride like the wind before I get old

It is the night
My body's weak
I'm on the run
No time to sleep
I've got to ride
Ride like the wind
To be free again

And I've got such a long way to go
To make it to the border of Mexico
So I'll ride like the wind
Ride like the wind",Christopher Cross,Pop
I Will (Take You Forever),"I was a man who always played around in love

so quick to take
but so afraid to give enough.
But now
I've found the one
and heaven will only know
what only my eyes can say and time can't take away.

I was a girl who trusted no one with my heart

and the dreams that young girls dream were just vanishing in the
dark.
But now
I've found the one
and heaven will only know
what only my eyes can say
they say -

That I will take you forever

and there will never be anyone else in my heart but you.
And I will take you forever

and there will never be anyone else but you
anyone else but you.

Now my touch belongs to you and I will always be your best friend

now my secrets are safe with you and the magic will never end.
Now you are the one
and heaven will only know
what only our eyes can say
they say -

That I will take you forever

and there will never be anyone else in my heart but you.
And I will take you forever

and there will never be anyone else but you
anyone else but you

anyone else but you.

All Right,"I know, I know what's on your mind
And I know it gets tough sometimes
But you can give it one more try
Find a reason why
You should pick it up
And try it again

'Cause it's all right
I think we're gonna make it
I think it might just work out this time
It's all right
I think we're gonna make it
I think it might work out fine this time
It's all right
I think we're gonna make it
I think it might just work out
'Cause it's not too late for that
Too late for me

I know I've been hurt before
And I know I really shouldn't give any more
But this time
This time things seem just a little different
And when I look in your eyes
You know I can see that it's true
And I hear you say it's

All right
I think we're gonna make it
I think it might just work out this time
It's all right
I think we're gonna make it
I think it might work out fine this time
It's all right
I think we're gonna make it
I think it might just work out
'Cause it's not too late for that
Too late for love

Just when you feel helpless
Nothing left to say
Love will find us
The past behind us
Then we're on our way

Time and time again I see
People so unsure like me
We all know it gets hard sometimes
You can give it one more try
Find another reason why
You should pick it up
You should kick it up
And try it again

Love Is Love (in Any Language),"Checkin' out the sand streets
Of this island town
Got my cold Dos Equis
Watchin' women brown
They call it Paradiso
It looks like paradise
And it's looking better all the time

Now I'm dancin' in the moonlight
The party's everywhere
It's all a sweet seduction
To the rhythm in the air
Local girls are talkin'
I hear their bodies say
This boy won't be leavin' lonely

It's je t'aime, it's amore
Te quiero, mi chica
If it's good, you'll get the message
It's je t'aime, it's amore
Eu te amo

She caught my intention
When I caught her eye
We just started movin'
Never askin' why
Faded into passion

Love can take you 'round the world

A Fisherman's Tale,"Took my troubles
Down to the sea
Put my ear to a seashell
Inquisitively

Thought I heard a heartbeat
It could have been mine
I guess it doesn't matter
In the grand design

Like a windblown sail
Like a fisherman's tale
There's no end to the glory
Like a windblown sail
Like a fisherman's tale
There's no end to the story

Don't let your vision
Go down with the sun
'Cause it might be cloudy
When tomorrow comes

Where the winds of a heart
Meet the wiles of a mind
There will be stillness
At the waterline

When I was young and time was free
I thought the world was reaching out for me
I believed I could
I believed I would
Live forever and ever

Took my troubles
Down to the sea
Put my ear to a seashell
Inquisitively",Christopher Cross,Pop
Every Turn Of The World,"We think about the loves we lost
Will it come again
We think of all the things we want
Will we ever win

We listen to the voice of children
Will they find their way
Keep an open heart
The answer to it all's a wish away

Never let the tears you're cryin' blind you
To the dream that's waitin' to find you
'Cause there's one more chance
With every turn of the world

Is it gold or glory
A taste of freedom
Or the strong warm touch of a body
There are all these things with every turn of the world

Human kindness -- diamond of the heart
Tearing down the old walls
As long as we can share
Desire's not a sin, after all

When you find yourself alone
Missing tender magic touching you
Keep an open heart
Everything you dream can still be true

We all want a world we can live in
We all want a world full of love
It's never too late
It's never too soon
Whatever you can do is enough",Christopher Cross,Pop

What's happening
Yeah me too
Just can't seem to shake those ordinary blues
One thing I can tell you
Hold your spirit tight
Something's on the move
It's gonna be alright

On the way down to paradise
I kept stepping on my wings
The tears, the time, the trouble
I had to take a stand
I found my way to land
I'm gonna be alright

Sometimes I think I live by miracles alone
Click those ruby slippers and hope to be back home
Say just where I'll find you
And that's just where I'll be

Walking in Avalon,"Maybe I remind you of a lover you had
Maybe I'm crazy and I make you laught
Maybe you thought I had a lot of cash
I don´t care what it was
But I love what it does

I really dig that your apartment's a mess
I dig the way the sun shines through your dress
I did your industrial shoes
I could say I'm kinky I guess
I can´t believe my luck
You're such a fabulous fabulous mmm

And drunk on everything
Her hero in Avalon
A man who would be king

It's cool that I like John and you like Paul
Baby it's cool forever cool that your spirit is free
And still you've chosen me

How we found our clothes I'll never know
Baby I hope I've loved you the way that you have loved me

Love Is Calling,"The journey has been long
A thousand memories strong
Faced with the night
Not caring who is right
Looking for the laughter that's been gone

How did we used to touch
Why do we think so much
We tire of the words of reflection
And long for affection
For the lovers' rush

Now that we're here after all of these years
Love is calling

Now that we're here so far and so near
Love is calling

Time and again we've trid

To let our feelings slide
Endless negotiations
And unmet expectations
Let's set it all aside

Now that we're here and our motives are clear
Love is calling

Now that we're here--plaintive, sincere
Love is calling

I have been lying still
I have been lying still
Dreaming of the truth

The journey has been long
The candor made us strong
Holding you tonight
In this familiar light
Can we take this sweetness to the dawn

Now that we're here and the walls disappear
Love is calling

Now that we're here and there's no one to fear
Love is calling

Now that we're here after all of the tears
Love is calling
Now that we're here--we're finally here

But I must confess
It really doesn't seem to matter
'Cause I'd follow that girl all around the world

Gonna tell 'em 'bout me and you
Gonna show 'em what love can do when it's right

But sometimes it fades away
Then you find one that can shine like the sun

But now she's here and we are all together",Christopher Cross,Pop
Is There Something,"Lately I see clouds of sorrow in your eyes
Some deep sadness you can never quite disguise
Now I'm scared to ask what it's leading to
But I'm more afraid of not asking you
Is there something that you want to tell me
Is there something that I ought to know
Are we something that's still worth fighting for
Or should I simply let you go
Is there something I can do to reach you
Are we something more than history
I'll find some way to convince you to stay
If you just tell me honestly
Is there something left of you and me
You've got secrets you've been keeping for too long
And I'm going crazy acting like there's nothing wrong
I can taste the truth every time we kiss
And I can't go on
At least not like this
I don't want to lose you
But what's the use of holding on
I don't really have you
If the feeling's gone
Is there something I can do to reach you
Are we something more than history
If there's no way to convince you to stay
And be the way we used to be
Then there's something that I want to tell you
And I want you to believe it's true
We had something that I'll never forget
Even if I wanted to
'Cause part of me will always be with you

Curled up Around the World,"Life is a long road - everyone knows it
Nothing is ever the way that you suppose it
The window blows open the moment you close it
And hatred finds a way into your heart.

Living escapes us - lost in our labors
Doing our damage and blaming our neighbors
Praying to paper and begging for favors
And hatred finds a way into our hearts.

Picture a place where your love makes a difference
Where silence has meaning and the noble run free
Cradle the dream of your sisters and brothers
Arms gently curled around the world

We can relinquish the sorrows that hold us
Taking our strength back from those we let control us
Letting acceptance and mercy enfold us
And clear the path for love to find a way into our hearts

Picture a place where your love makes a difference
Where silence has meaning and the noble run free
Cradle the dream of your sisters and brothers
Arms gently curled around the world

We can find the way to hold this world inside our hearts

Picture a place where your love makes a difference
Where silence has meaning and the noble run free
Cradle the dream of your sisters and brothers
Arms gently curled around the world

I will remember my love makes a difference
And try to recall that it all begins with me
Cradle the dream of a sweet ever after
With arms gently curled around the world
Arms gently curled around the world

It all could come true...",Christopher Cross,Pop
"Been There, Done That","You've seen my face
Hey don't you know my name
It wasn't all that long ago i had my fifteen minutes of fame
If it was you caught in a crazy game
Would you still look as good standing in the rain

Whatever gets you through the night
Take it from me -- it's gonna be alright

Been there done that
Been there -- then somebody takes you back
Been there done that
So hard hard to avoid the trap

They break your heart -- why do we let them in
The drug is strong but the will is weak
We make the same mistakes again
There comes a time we all gotta rise above
Look inside and redefine just what it is we want from love

Been there done that
Been there -- still working my way back
Been there done that
So hard hard to avoid the trap

And when you feel strong enough to face up to it
You're gonna do just fine",Christopher Cross,Pop

Wishing Well,"In this land of accessories
The obsolescent sheen
Like so many fools before us
Lost in dreams

What's behind the curtain
The dinette or the stole
Such important choices
To satisfy the soul

Take it on down to the wishing well
Make a wish to stop your wishing
'Cause you just can't tell
Give it up

The power of suggestion
The tabloids and the tube
Muscles and money
Tits and glory
What's your story

Are we so unhappy
Being what we are

Everybody is a star
Give it up",Christopher Cross,Pop
Back of My Mind,"I woke up to my world this morning
Took a long look in the looking glass
Last night I guess I had one or too many
Somebody tried to tell me I had no class

What ever happened to me
Maybe I've been living on lies
Never really had a dream come true
Then again I guess I never really tried


Now the years all slip away
And things are like they're gonna stay
All the roads I didn't take are just
One more thing in the back of my mind
Taking space and time


Wish I'd finished that book I never started
Maybe that's the story of my life
Should've learned to play that saxophone
So I could tell my song to the streetlight


Shouldn't have been so stuck on my own
Could've had a wife and a child
Should've made that house a home
I don't know why my life is so wild


Now the years all slip away
And things are like they're gonna stay
All the chances I didn't take are just
One more thing in the back of my mind
Taking space and time
One more thing in the back of my mind


So I'm thinking about a walk in the sunlight
I've got to get my shadow behind me
Try and make some sense of it all
With my feet on the ground and my heart still free


As the years will slip away
I'll let the cards fall where they may
And all the roads I didn't take will be just
One more thing in the back of my mind


As the years will slip away
And the cards fall as they may
All the chances I didn't take will be just
One more thing in the back of my mind
Taking space and time
One more thing in the back of my mind
One more thing in the back of my mind

Thinkin' 'Bout You,"Ooh ooh oooh oooh ooh
Thinkin' 'bout you
Oooh ooh ooh ooh
Thinkin' 'bout

I've been thinkin' bout you
Thinkin' 'bout all the things that couldn't come true
I've been thinkin' 'bout you
And how much I'll miss having you to talk to

Now that I'm on my own
I don't need to hold you
But I'd love to
There's beauty in monochrome
I promise not to linger
But somehow lately

I've been thinkin' 'bout you
Thinkin' 'bout all those things we put ourselves through
Incompatibly
Playing out our restless parts so crazy and free
Those nights when we talked til the sun
We had all the answers
We were dancers
Then time caught us both on the run
In our own directions
Headed for the moon

I know you
And I know that you think of me too
All is well
Honey but I'm just sittin' here thinkin' 'bout you
Thinkin' 'bout you

I've been thinkin' 'bout you
How you said you'd never change and hoping it's true
In your impetuous way
You brought out the kind of fire still with me today
When you told me you had to go
Off to chase the rainbow
Oh it hurt me so
The pain didn't kill me though
I will always be here
The soul outlives the heart

I know you

Between our hands and Jacob's ladder

It's Always Something,"It's always something
It's always something there to spoil your day
It's always something made out of nothing
But it gets its way

My AOL went down again
They're starving in Zaire
Close your eyes and count to ten
The sky is falling dear

It's always something
Something you're waiting that will make you whole
Some piece of nothing you need so badly
That youl'd sell your soul

How many inches is your screen
Are the images too clear
Just channel surf the news away
The sky is falling
Your god is calling

I may not know it
I may not see
It's always something messin' with me
I may not like it but it will be
And if I fight it'll never be free

There's always something we could be learning
From those windmill fores
It's always someone you least expected
Who really knows

That there's no better time or place
To read between the lines on your face
Stop choking on that grain of salt
The sky's not falling
We've just been staling

I may not know it
I may not see
It's always something messin' with me
I may not like it but it will be
And if I fight it'll never be free",Christopher Cross,Pop
Deal 'Em Again,"You pick up the cards that they're dealing to you
You can throw down or showdown
The bluff makes a fool out of you
The ante goes up and your luck runs down
It's a strange game
It's a damn shame
But somebody's going to lose
It don't matter -- lose or win
You can deal 'em again

A handful of hearts and you're playing to win
It goes down and you're put down
And that takes it all out of you
One last hand and you're going for broke
The cards fall and you take all
Just when you thought you were through
It don't matter -- lose or win
You can deal 'em again


You pick up the cards that they're dealing to you
You can throw down or showdown
When love makes a fool out of you

Angry Young Men,"Father

Doin' the best they can

Out there livin' on the lam
Heedless
Guarded
Makes it hard to understand

Trust won't come easily
I know it's hard to believe
Nobody meant you no harm

All the lonely young girls
Caught in a web of confusion
In an unintended world

To come to maturity
With some sense of dignity

Nobody means you no harm

All the lonely old women
All the angry old men
Hoping the hurt was behind them
Starting it over again

Love can be the reality
But only as far as the heart can see

With all this history
Trust won't come easily
I know it's hard to believe
Nobody needs you

To come to maturity

Any Old Time,"Everyone maybe once or twice
Finds a friend that's a friend for life
Somebody who believed in me like you
From those days of childhood fights
Through the nights when we'd ask advice
All of those times when nobody else would do

Any old time that you wanna hear from me
To find your way or kick around a memory
Like the old times
Any old time will do


I can tell when the telephone rings
It's gonna be you just to talk about things
It's funny how it seems to happen when you're on my mind
Every time good love goes bad
When I can't believe the luck I've had
All of those times I'm glad you're a friend of mine


Any old time that you need to call on me
To find your way or kick around those memories
Like the old times
Any old time will do


Don't you ever forget
Any old time when the road is getting rough to climb
And you think maybe you've had enough
Just like the old times
Any old time you're blue


All at once I went and got a hunch
Everything we ever felt was true
As we find the years behind us and we live the years ahead
Let's remember laughter and all the words we said


Make new friends and keep the old
One is silver and the other one's gold
Something Sally said that stuck in my head
And I never wanna let it go


Any old time that you need to lean on me
I'll be there -- you can dream on me
Just like the old times
Any old time will do

Before I Go,"I look out on the city lights
The guarded streets below
I marvel at my history
The things that I don't know
Just another question
A shadow on my soul
Will there be time
Will there be time before I go

I left home in a hurry
Off to see the world
Then I played some music
Then I loved a girl
Someone called me papa
Took my breath away
Would I be fine
Would I be alright with just today
Will there be time enough for me before I go

Love without rules
Love without end
Sending a lofty prayer for peace out on the wind
Breaking the curse
Breaking the chain.....
Making a promise I won't have to make again

I look out on the city lights
The stories that they tell
And wonder at my destiny
Beyond this carousel
Such a hollow question
A tether frayed by fear
Will there be time
Time to let go while I'm here
Will there be time enough for me so I'll know
Will there be time enough for me before I go

Charm The Snake,"You gotta keep a straight face
When you're playin' the fool
You gotta wear a smile
When you're breakin' the rules
You gotta charm that snake now, baby

You gotta be smooth,you gotta be quick
I think it might just help
To be a little bit sick
You know the bite can't cut you
If the skin is thick
You gotta charm that snake now, baby

Hey, we ain't all good lookin'
Ain't no reason to take a good lickin'
The clock on the wall's
Gonna keep on tickin'
Charm that snake now, baby

Don't let go of it
Don't let go
You gotta charm that snake
You gotta charm that snake

One stripe, two stripes
What does it mean
The venom is lethal
But the meat is clean
The best take advantage of you like a machine
You gotta charm that snake now, maybe

Don't let the fingernails
Under the heart
If they get a good grip
They're gonna rip it apart
The first and last kisses
Are the dangerous part
You gotta charm that snake now, maybe

There's a hook in the bait
The first one made a mistake
If you've got what it takes
You better charm that snake
You gotta let it show
You ain't gonna let it go
I'm gonna let 'em know
I'm never gonna let it go",Christopher Cross,Pop
Deputy Dan,"Deputy Dan

Just another pure heart
A wide open mind
Driftin' like a cork on a sea of dreams
Playin' the school boy
Makin' believe
Dyin' to fill the shoes
The really big shoos for the TV screams

Chorus:
Standing on the sidelines when I was a kid
Talkin' bout the heroes and the war
Living on the frontlines wasn't quite the same
Something deep inside of me had changed

Dedicated upstart entourage
In the garage
four crazy Juveniles
Burnin' up the midnight miles
The gigs
The juke box guinea pigs
Spending our prime
Hey man
Honkey-tonk women just one more time

Chorus:

Took a ride on the wild wind
And lost myself an old friend'
Don't ask me now if I'd do it again

Dream Too Loud,"While I wait for the world to end
Above mad hatter crowds
I have nothing but time to spend
Silhouetting clouds

Simple pleasures fr goodness sake
Babes in slumbers
Nature's palette an daybreak,
Paint by numbers
Tat tvram asi

Barefoot down at the fishin'hole
Minnows nibble my toes
Big rock holding a bamboo pole
Don't care how is goes

Origami my lists away
Bird and flower
On a river of wind they play
Peace and power

I'm just looking to find some spring
Plant some seeds grow some wings
Don't tell me I dream too loud I knos

Just imagine a smile on your face
Love and laughter
Compassion breaking our fall from grace
Ever after

Driftin' Away,"The clock is screaming and it's time to go
The day is waiting and you're moving slow
News and weather on the radio
But your mind keeps driftin' away

Work is steady and your friends are good
You're going forward like you think you should
You'd put your heart into it if you could
But your mind keeps driftin' away

Look at your world through the windowpane
Embrace that secret thing that keeps you sane
You're always saying that you can't complain
But your mind keeps driftin' away
And your mind keeps driftin' away

The conversation turns to seeds you've sown
It gets you thinkin' 'bout someone you've known
She's always with you but she's still alone
And your mind keeps driftin' away

We make excuses but you know damn well
A dream's a story only you can tell
You've tasted heaven and you've been through hell
But your mind keeps driftin' away
And your mind keeps driftin' away

Another sunset another dawn
Hard to distinguish where the lines are drawn
Hard to imagine where the time has gone
You might discover you're where you belong
When your mind is driftin' away
And your mind keeps driftin' away

We make excuses but you know damn well
A dream's a story only you can tell
You've tasted heaven and you've been through hell
But your mind keeps driftin' away
And your mind keeps driftin' away
And your mind keeps driftin' away",Christopher Cross,Pop
Hunger,"Out of this island
Far from the cage that most will know
Nothing was sacred
No other footprints in the snow
You took me down girl
Down to a place where I don't go
Now I hunger for you
Baby I hunger for you

The trace of you on my fingers
Laughs at the rain
Opiiate angel
The jones in my vein
Something so desperate inside
Somthing I just can't explain
Baby I hunger for you
Baby I hunger for you

Holding on to something pure
Holding on to something pure

Out of this island
The wind in my soul is never still
This weathered asylum
Just can't keep out the chill
I'm scared that I'll find you
I'm scared even more I never will
Baby I hunger for you
Baby I hunger for you",Christopher Cross,Pop
I Know You Well,"A good fight half won
A good scotch half gone
And I'll never win Mr Congeniality

She acquiesced
And I got off on a technicality

I've always loved our little wars
Treaties we sign behind closed doors
I may concede but I will not bleed
I will not bleed

The James Deam the prom queen
Impractical fascination
Having its way again
She knows Astaire's got nothing on me
When I take her out tonight
When I take her out tonight

I've always loved the way you dance
How you defy our circumstance
There may not be more than see
More than I see
C'est la vie

I know you well (You know me well)
I know you well (You know me well)
I know you well boy
And before the dawn comes you'll be gone

It's symbiotic
It's a sweet narcotic
Not a futile search for romantic perfection
That's too much trouble
So make mine a double
My head's a very scary neighborhood
Don´t wanna walk it alone

Thought I had something to day
Before you kissed my neck that way
I'll let it be
That works for me
So C'est la vie
C'est la vie

I know you well (You know me well)
I know you well (You know me well)
I know you well boy
And before the dawn comes you'll be gone

You know me well (I know you well)
You know me well (I know you well)

I Really Don't Know Anymore,"What do you think about love
Is it a game to be played
To be torn and lost in the wilderness
To be lost
And lonely after all

What do you think about love
Is it a way to be saved
To feel the warmth of another love
To be lost
And lonely after all


I really don't know anymore
I really can't say
I really don't know anymore
I'm just that way


What do you think about love
Is it a game to be played
To keep your heart and have never loved
To be lost
And lonely after all


What do you think about love
Is it a way to be saved
To give up your heart to another love
To be lost
And lonely after all

Let the light discover you
Fall into the pillows
Let me watch you play
Sharing all your secrets
Take my breath alway

Learn you like a blind man
Taste you soft and deep
Slow and gentle torture
Pray the lord your soul to keep
Take the night inside you
Let the fires dance
Planets spin their fortunes
Lost inside our trance

In a Red Room
Where love takes no prisoners
Ancient ballets of shadow perform
Here we lie in a sweet saturnalia
Here we will ride out the storm

On and on passlon plays surround us
Toying with the histories of man
On and on, taboos will not confound us
Naked in a jungle by Gauguin

On and on passlon plays surround us
Toying with the histories of man
On and on taboos will not confound us
I will look at you and understand

In a Red Room
Where love takes no prisoners
Ancient ballets of shadow perform
Here we lie in a sweet saturnalia
Here we will ride out the storm

In a Red Room
Where love takes no prisoners
We will drink from this cup til we die
Out of body in sweet saturnalia
Ever alive you and I",Christopher Cross,Pop
In the Blink of an Eye,"She said baby baby

That it's time for you to try
And get yourself the things that are yours

'Cause it could be gone in the blink of an eye
It could be dawn in the blink of an eye

And let yourself go

I know what you mean and I swear
That if there's a song in the night
You know I've gotta hear it out there

And let yourself go
There's a fire deep inside

Let's steal the moon and let love have it's way
Burning like a falling star until we are
A million miles away

It could be gone in the blink of an eye
It could be dawn in the blink of an eye
Isn't it time that you reached for the sky
And let yourself go now
There's a fire deep inside
Let yourself go now
And forget the fears you hide
Let yourself go now
And forget the tears you cried

And when you needed me
Did I just turn away
And when I spoke my heart
Is there something I forgot to say",Christopher Cross,Pop
Jan's Tune,"Lost in the future
Worried about the past
Willful and lazy
Pedaling nowhere fast

She works her wonders
Keeping me in today
Reaching through my darkness
Reminding me how to play

And she says
Save your sadness for the bad times
Time is not your enemy
Save your sadness for the bad times
For now you are with me

Nothing is certain
Certainly nothing new
Hoping some light shines
On us before we`re through

She spends her heartbeats
Seeing the best in you
As I learn my mind the more I find
The things she says are true

You live gracefully
Having faith in me

She says
Save your sadness for the bad times
Time is not your enemy
Save your sadness for the bad times
For now
Save your sadness for the bad times
For now you are with me",Christopher Cross,Pop
Just One Look,"On the outback, a fool for the wind
Forgot to count my blessings again
The road looks lonely, I could use a friend
Looking for somebody to forgive my sins

And just one look in your eyes
Before I go so I'll know
Somebody loves me


All the wise men, all the years
Looking for the answer in a roomful of mirrors
A dark companion, the one called fear
Take the holy water wash away the tears


One hope I will find
The harmony of heart and mind
So I will know
The way to give as I live


And I know there will be
A certain amount of uncertainty
But I must know
That you are there to hear my prayers


One wish there will be
In this place a time for me
When I will know
Before I go
Somebody loves me
Just one look in your eyes
Before I go so I'll know
Somebody loves me

Looking for the answer in a roomful of mirrors
A dark companion, the one called fear
Take the holy water wash away the tears

Kind of I Love You,"I've been thinkin' how to say
What I think I'm supposed to say
To make you sure that I am worth your time
Your friends all tell you it's not true
I got no business here with you
I'm just not the man they had in mind
They may be right but it's too late now
I want you to see the best in me

Won't you hold me, kiss me, stroke me, please me
Tell me I'm the perfect man

All my life I've spent my time
Falling in and out of love
And I always run when I find me one

While I'm trying to fill a grown man's shoes
I hope I don't turn away from you
But if I screw this up forgive me
It's really the best I can do

And I'm lookin' to find an answer before the dawn

Only a fool would let you go baby
And I've been a fool too long

Long World,"There's a brand new light in my life
Shines after the candle is out at night
It's gotten the best of me
It's got my heart and it won't set it free

If I did, well it might be a lie

It's a long world we're living in
I've got to have her from beginning to end
It's long world we're living in
I just can't live without her


Does anybody know how it feels to want her this bad
So bad you'd give your life away

Who needs someone like I need you


And I wait for the day to take her away in vain
And I realize I'll always feel the same

Never Stop Believing,"Every night in my window
I see pictures of the day we met
I keep wishing on the falling stars
To forget you but it hasn't happened yet

And I still remember when you walked away
It was more than my heart could believe
Careless wind blew the smell of your perfume away
But the touch of you
It never leaves


So I'll never stop believing
Someday your love is coming back to me
No I'll never stop believing
Someday that you'll be coming back to me


Everybody in my life
They say forget that girl
She's gone for good
How can I explain this heart
It just keeps hanging on
Cause something says it should


Oh I go on remembering how good we were
The sweetest days I'll ever know
This careless boy
Somehow he let you get away
But the touch of you
He'll never let it go


Time and time again I see
Just how much she meant to me
Oh a love like that is meant to be
She's got to come back
She's got to come back

Night Across the World,"I've heard there could be desire
So strong you would brave the fire
Until now I made them liars
Now there is you

'Cause something about your touch
Is making me feel too much
And letting you go is such a hard thing to do

And when the dawn is closing in
I know I need to drown in your love again
I'd chase the night across the world
To spend one more minute with you

When morning lay just ahead
And daybreak invades our bed
I'll steal you away instead
And fly to the dark

'Cause when the dawn is closing in
I know I need to drown in your love again
I'd chase the night across the world
To spend one more minute with you
Alone with you

Hold on
Our wings will not fail us

We will follow the moon and its power

No Time for Talk,"Well I read it in town in the melancholy news
The front page story is our love is through
The hand of time is cold -- I can't stand to hear the truth
Somehow I won't believe it 'til I've heard it from you

But there's no time for talk
And there's no place for tears
There's no reason to wonder after all of these years
Sure we had some good times
And so who's to blame
It's so hard to tell when you both feel the pain


After the years have come and gone
The struggle to forget you will have just begun
We had our ups and downs but one thing's for sure
No one will ever love you more

Nothing Will Change,"The boys find a home in a family born of hate
The girls plant desperate love
In a womb that just won't wait
Forgotten mother pushes a cart with her heart
Through a twisted fate

As walls come down and spirits rise
The business of fear never dies
The artful dodgers with their false alarms
Take from the mouths to feed the arms
Pit god against god for a piece of land
They think they hear his words but they don't understand

Like a river lost on its way to the sea
Where is humanity
I know that nothing will change
'Til it changes in me
'Til it changes in you

A plague upon the mind

Open up My Window,"Every night
I open up my window
Open up my window
And let your love come in

Every night that I'm away from you
This old bed seems way too big
And my dreams so small
Goin' through the motions
As I stare out from my room
I begin to realize
That we're sharin' the same moon

Lying here hugging my pillow in the dark
Dreaming of your comfort
Fightin' the lonely in my heart
And I thought I felt you touch me
In that old familiar way
When the wind came through the curtains
And I heard it call your name

Ooh the time goes draggin' by
Send my love across the sky
Maybe it's all that I can do
Baby until I'll be with you

I missed you girl more than you'll ever know
I kept a little vigil by my window
It's funny but it's true
Darlin' I did the same for you
Now no matter where we are
We can wish upon that star",Christopher Cross,Pop

She must hide her tears
For nobody wants to see them
Surely it will break her heart
Time passes as she waits for a friend

We'll take all the doubtful ones in the fight
And make them hold off 'til the spring
Take hold of their hallowed souls
And save them from pain
All of the pain
Save ourselves from all of the pain


Dearly held are the friends
Left in the years and lost in the war
Dearly held are the loves
Save for the ones you lose on your own


Stars will light up the lonely nights
Harbor lights
Making us believe in the love
So struck by the hope of the harmony
Leaving the sorrow
Gently

She must hide her tears
For nobody wants to see them
Surely she will win a heart

Rendezvous,"All across the sky
The mysteries of faith
Fossils of desire all assume their rightful place
Is there any danger in their fire
Is there any solace in their wake
Could it really make a world of difference for goodness' sake

Train rolls a cappella
To a sympathetic moon
Carrying the stories of every heart - earned wound
Will there be a lover at the station
Will there be a last conductor's call
Will there really be a happy ending after all

To the rendezvous
Fortunes to be told
To the rendezvous
Wonders to behold
Onto a place where we can find
Maybe a trace of peace of mind
To the rendezvous all in good time

Painting the horizon
A mast beyond the blue
Caught up in the tempest of another point of view
Could there be a mutiny in the making
Could it be a lorelei in song
Is it just a ghost that's been forgiven all along

Will there be a jewel beneath the boulder
Will there be a pride beyond the fall
Will there really be a happy ending after all
Will there be a pride beyond the fall
Will there really be a happy ending after all

Fortunes to be told
To the rendezvous
Wonders to behold
Onto a place where people find
Maybe a trace of peace of mind
To the rendezvous all in good time",Christopher Cross,Pop
Save Your Sadness,"Lost in the future
Worried about the past
Willful and lazy
Pedaling nowhere fast

She works her wonders
Keeping me in today
Reaching through my darkness
Reminding me how to play


And she says
Save your sadness for the bad times
Time is not your enemy
Save your sadness for the bad times
For now you are with me

Nothing is certain
Certainly nothing new
Hoping some light shines
On us before we are through
She spends her heartbeats
Seeing the best in you
As I learn my mind the more I find
The things she says are true


And she says
Save your sadness for the bad times
Time is not your enemy
Save your sadness for the bad times
For now you are with me

You live gracefully
Having faith in me

And she says
Save your sadness for the bad times
Time is not your enemy
Save your sadness for the bad times
For now, for now
Save your sadness for the bad times
For now you are with me",Christopher Cross,Pop
Say You'll Be Mine,"Say you'll be mine
Say you'll be mine until the sun shines
Say you'll be mine
And bring me the dream of a lifetime

I just can't hide the truth no more
I've got to get my feet back down on the floor
I love you so
I need you so
I just don't think I can let you go

Say you'll be mine
Say you'll be mine until the sun shines
Say you'll be mine
And bring me the dream of a lifetime

Well, it's you that keeps me feeling this way
I don't think I can take it even one more day
It don't seem right
That I should be alone tonight

Say you'll be mine
Say you'll be mine until the sun shines
Say you'll be mine

She Told Me So,"We all know how the story begins
How we fall so easily in
To love
Then a boy breaks a girl's heart
A girl breaks a boy's heart
Goodbye is a very hard word to forget
But I think I finally met
The girl
To take away those yesterdays

Oh she loves me, she told me so
As a tear came to her eye
And I love her, I will, I know
Love her for the rest of my life


Once more I'm feeling like I'm out of control
Cause the girl's got a serious hold
On me
And part of me says run away
But I wanna stay
Should I be up front or cool
Which way is playing the fool
The only time I know what's right
Is when I hear her telling me


Somewhere there's a star in the sky of every night
Shining for the love of hearts
The light of that star, like the hand of a friend
Leading me back to love again


If you love her let her know
Let her see all the secrets in your heart
If she loves you she'll only love you more
As she find out who you are

",Christopher Cross,Pop
Someday,"Here's a song for the hearts so lonely
The ones who feel that love won't come
Looking to find that one and only
I've got something to say to you

You see the lovers walking down the street
You feel your life's a little incomplete
I know what you mean and I'm here to tell you
Wipe the tears from your eyes
You know I would not lie


Save your love for someday, girl
Someday will come soon
Save your love for someday, girl
Someday will come soon


You give your love away to someone new
Just so you can say that he belongs to you
You smile and you laugh and you talk of forever
I'm not so sure that it's true


Don't give up on love
Someday will come soon


After you've found that dream you treasure
After the chill has left the air
All of the pieces will come together
The things that two can share
But only time can take you there

Spinning,"Ooh wee

Got me spinning 'round

It's only the beginning
You got me spinning'round

Swept Away,"I never had anything happen so fast
Took one look and I shattered like glass
I guess I let it show
Cause your smile told me you knew
That you're everything I ever wanted at once
There's no holding this heart
When it knows what it wants
And I never wanted anything more than to know you

I was swept away
No one in the world but you and I
Gotta find a way
To make you feel the way that I do
I was swept away
Without a warning
Like night when the morning begins the day
I was swept away

And so it begins
This journey of love
The summer wind carries us to places all our own
The words of a look
The language of touch
The way that you want me means so much
And I never wanted anything more
Than to love you

I am swept away
No one in the world but you and I
Gotta find a way
To make you feel the way that I do
I am swept away
Without a warning
Like night when the morning begins the day
I was swept away
Away, seeing my tomorrow's in your eyes
I was swept away

Oo, I hope I wake up soon
Oo, I'm a victim of that crazy moon

The very first time you said my name
I knew it would never sound the same
Something about me has changed forever

Can't you see I am swept away
No one in the world but you and I
Gotta find a way
To make you feel the way that I do
I am swept away
Without a warning
Like night when the morning begins the day
I was swept away
Away, seeing my tomorrow's in your eyes
Gotta find a way
To make you feel the way that I do
I was swept away
Without a warning
Like night when the morning begins the day

Talking in My Sleep,"Talking in my sleep
She ain't gonna hear it
So my secrets have to keep
A little while longer
In my heart where they've been
For so long I can't remember

Days turn into weeks
Still she's not with me
Still my secrets have to keep
A little while longer
In my heart where they've been
For so long I can't remember


And I know that I'm just gonna be
Another page in love's history
Another page in your diary
In that old book of love


Love can cut you deep
It's there to remind you
And the memories make you weak
They whisper to you
From your heart where they've been
For so long you can't remember


Wake up
Reach for her
She's not there
All I do is dream
Dream that she will come home soon

That Girl,"I'm wakin' up in the same old way
But I can't shake me out of the dream
Every time that I close my eyes
I see her face
Like a star on a TV screen
They all keep askin'
Where you been after dark
I say
That kinda girl
She grows on a heart
And I know
It doesn't come any better

That girl
She makes me sing
She gives me things that only love can bring
That girl
She makes me sing

If you think
I'm losin' my cool
That's true
But I betcha'd do the same
If you felt the flame
Of her fire
She likes to make you
Crazy with love
And I let her
I know it doesn't come any better

I see their eyes
I see their eyes as she walks by
She knows she's fine
I know she's mine
C-c-cuz she digs me",Christopher Cross,Pop
The Light Is On,"Is it yours
Is it mine
I was never the kind who could draw the line
Are you free
Unforgiven
Is this the kind of world you could live in

It's alright
The light is on
The darkness has run to hide
It's alright
The light is on
But the darkness is just outside
Outside your window


Beating down
Making the sound of the rain
Drive you crazy
Make you lazy
You know it's only the rain

Think Of Laura,"Every once in a while I'd see her smile
And she'd turn my day around
A girl with those eyes could stare through the lies
And see what your heart was saying

CHORUS:
Think of Laura but laugh don't cry
I know she'd want it that way
When you think of Laura laugh don't cry
I know she'd want it that way

A friend of a friend, a friend till the end
That's the kind of girl she was
Taken away so young
Taken away without a warning

I know you and you're here
In everyday we live
I know her and she's here
I can feel her when I sing

Hey Laura, where are you now
Are you far away from here
I don't think so
I think you're here
Taking our tears away

Uncharted Hearts,"As the sun rises it soon compromises the safety of night
And two travelers in spite of themselves
Have to push on

Mornings remind them of things left behind them
One a good wife and the other a life with no name
So they push on

Over the hills and the plains they ride
Sharing the unwritten law they abide
Two uncharted hearts in the silence of their own flight

The journey they measure in danger and pleasure
One likes to bluff and the other is tough on the girls
Still they push on

Roll the bones
Devil-may-care
No questions asked
Barely friends
Two solitaires
Needing each other out there

They build a good fire before they retire
Searching the flame for a moment of blameless repose
A way to push on
Lessons come hard on this brave terrain
They may run free but they're still in the rain
Two uncharted hearts in the silence of their own flight",Christopher Cross,Pop
What Am I Supposed to Believe,"Some like it hot
Some like it cold
I like it best when it's untold
When I feel sad
And when I feel down
Then I'll wish you were around

What am I supposed to believe
Is it that you really love me

Turn down the lights now
It's all been said
The troubles that come and go
You took my heart and threw it away
You left me out in the rain

What am I supposed to believe
Is is that you really love me
Just you wait
You wait and see
I will be there to love you

Oh it's hard
So hard to live a life on your own
After you've known how it could be
With you and me
Won't you come home to me
You could make everything all right
You could warm me through the coldest night
And make it all right",Christopher Cross,Pop
When She Smiles,"Well they met in line at the checkout stand
Both unaware of what the gods had planned
She was lost in her Cosmo readin' about the stars
He was readin' about two-headed babies from Mars
When she reached for a Snickers she dropped her keys
And so began one of life's mysteries
He was a little old-fashioned and a little oversexed
He picked them up never guessing what would happen next

Then she smiled and said I like your tie
Yeah she smiled and told him that little white lie
And his soul lit up like the fourth of July
When she smiled

They made it to Starbuck's just before it closed
He pointed to the jar and said you want one of those
So over biscotti and double decafs
They shared their stories and they had some laughs
He got up his courage and asked her back to his place
Then he held his breath as he studied her face
She just sat and she stared and she said nothing at all
He knew he blew it and he waited for the ax to fall

Then she smiled and he knew he hadn't been wrong
Yeah she smiled and said what took you so long
And the world felt good like a rock and roll song
When she smiled

When she smiles I forget my lines
When she smiles man I'm on cloud nine
When she smiles oh it's time out of mind
When she smiles

Then she smiled and said where you been all my life
And she smiled when he asked her to be his wife
And the future had never looked so bright
When she smiled

I'm just diggin' her diggin' me diggin' her

When she smiles I forget my lines
When she smiles man I'm on cloud nine
When she smiles oh it's time out of mind
When she smiles

When she smiles I come all undone
When she smiles I'm the only one
When she smiles I'm a smoking gun
When she smiles

Wild Wild West,"Out here on the plains tonight
The white man rules the game
Searching through the flames tonight
There's no one left to blame

This town just don't seem big enough
For the likes of the two of us

Here in the wild wild west
In the wild wild west my friend
Living in the wild wild west
In the wild wild west again

We left our bootprint on the shore
And rode off on toward sunset
We left the natives on the cutting room floor
And the shooting's still not done yet

Lazy boy and channel three
Bourbon and contrition
Say a prayer for the NRA
And pass the ammunition

Folly and frustration
Mercy
Too much information

Desperate situation

Words of Wisdom,"I can hear your voice and I have no choice
Cause the pain is too deep inside
And the hurt of a love that is lost has no cure
But the love of another heart
Your friends try and say it will all get better
They say that they know how you feel
But your heart isn't sure 'cause it knows what it heard
All the things that it read in the letter

All the words of wisdom
Never seem to ease the pain
All the words of wisdom sound the same


All the lies of kindness
Oh that sweet refrain
But you pay the price for the joy that it brings
Cause you hear the sound of her name
And the morning tries to save you
From the shadows of your heart
They dance and kiss as you reminisce
And it's tearing you apart

So for all you party people who are in a state of shock
We're The New Kids On The Block!

Chillin' on the corner, the first day we arrived
>From the looks of the hoods, we didn't think we'd survive
Second day we were there, we were walking down the street
With a rhyme in mind and a funky beat


But when we turned into the alley, to our surprise
We saw a bunch of hoods right before our eyes
They looked us up and down once, twice and again
There must have been a hundred to a hundred and ten
So, I looked over my shoulder right at my friend
He said 'Nice knowing you' but this is the end


So we battened down the hatches and prepared to fight
Then all of a sudden I seen the light
The time was right, the time to rock
'Cause everybody knows, we're The New Kids On The Block.


We're also devistating when we're on stage
The fans start screaming and yelling with rage
With mic's in hand and rhymes with clout
So watch it sucker MCs or we're gonna turn you out


We never talk trash, our rhymes are clean
Our rhymes are never vague and we say nothing obscene
So any sucker MCs who wanna battle us
Can you go at least 20 lines without a cuss?
Cause once we start to jam, you'll be in a state of shock
Clear the way party people, we're The New Kids On The Block


Move it sucker MCs or you're gonna feel the wrath
So don't get caught up in the aftermath
Cause we're the funky MCs of the hip hop craze
Our rhymes are done by law and are sure to amaze


With a DJ cutting records, steady cross bass
We'll leave all you party people stuck in a daze
I say we're fresh, new and you know it's true
Now let me introduce you to the rest of the crew


J, he's fresh. He's the master of mix
There ain't no rhyme that he can't fix
Spinster's next, he's the king of the spin
And if you wanna battle, you ain't gonna win


Then there's Popeye, but we call him Jordan
The kid's so fresh, there'll never be boredom
Next is jon, whose word is true
But the party people know him as the runner GQ


I'm Dexter P. the wizard of word
I'm the greatest MC that you've ever heard
Now that you know we're a gang and you know we don't play",New Kids On The Block,Pop

This One's For The Children,"This a very serious message, so all of you...please listen.
There are some people living in this world,
They have no food to eat,
They have no place to go.
But we all are God's children,
We have to learn to love one another,
Just remember they could be us,
Remember we all are brothers.
I'm not tryin' to darken up your day,
But help others in need,
Show them there's a better way.

This one's for the children,
The children of the world.
This one's for the children,
May God keep them in his world.

Many people are happy,
And many people are sad.
Some people have many things,
That others can only wish they had.
So for the sake of the children,
Show them love's the only way to go,
'Cause they're our tomorrow,
And people they've got to know.
I'm not tryin' to darken up your day,
But help others in need,
And show them there's a better way.

This ones for the children,
The children of the world.
This one's for the children,
May God keep them in his world.

I think of you in october
When the rain starts to fall
I couldn't fight through the storm
So I built up a wall
I was looking
For something in all the wrong places
I was searching for love
In all the wrong faces

I saw a flicker of light in the darkness
Saw a reflection of me where your heart is

Baby, cause you
You're holding me up, you're holding me up
And I am thankful you
You're more than enough
You're more than enough
And I am thankful
Everything I ever wanted
Never knew until I got it
Because of you
I am thankful (I am thankful)

Sometimes the pressure of the city's
Got me slipping back, ah
But just the thought of you
In it helps me stay on track
And when they're all going out
Just know I'll be coming home baby
And when there's no one around
I know I'm not alone baby

I saw a flicker of light in the darkness
Saw a reflection of me where your heart is
Oh-oo-oh

Baby, cause you
You're holding me up (yes she did)
You're holding me up

Back To Life,"Another season come and passed,
Yet another role not taken.
Every dream I have and fulfilled,
I wanna scream, but I lost the will.

I take another step somehow
The only things that moves me is you right now.
Give me the strength to get up again.
My story's not over, this can't be the end.

Then your love, your love
Makes me believe that I can make things right
I'm coming back, coming back, coming back,
Coming back to life.

How soon we all forget, put it on the line
To live your life in debt.
I tell myself is too late to change
This is insane, I can't stay the same.

You let me out the dark,
You stopped the bleeding in my heart
Like does it make sense, but you'll understand
When I need you most you lend me your hand.

And your love, your love
Makes me believe that I can make things right
I'm coming back, coming back, coming back,
Coming back to life.

The weight of the world is lifting
I'm taking a deeper breath,
I'm seeing things a little bit clearer.
I turned in a world when I finally found
The man in the mirror.
How soon we all forget?

Then your love, your love
It makes me believe that I can make things right
I'm coming back, coming back, coming back,
Coming back to life.

I believe in your love.

And baby when you look in my eyes

Girl, you're all that I need
You're all I want

Kissin' and a-huggin'
Oh you keep me burning
Hey girl, this is really for real!

Fighting Gravity,"Sorry if I'm speaking out of line,
But I don't want this night to be over,
I don't want it to end.

Cause it seems like when our worlds collide
It just don't feel right not to hold you,
It's getting hard to be friends.

Do you feel what I feel the closer that we get
It's almost like there's a force that we can't resist.

Baby, tell me why, why you wanna stop
What's happening inside it's bigger than you and me,
It's like we're fighting gravity.
Even if we run we'll be like a shadow
Running from the sun, something you can't escape.
It's gonna pull you back to me.
You'll be fighting, fighting, fighting gravity,
Fighting, fighting, fighting gravity,
Fighting, fighting, fighting, fighting gravity.

Baby, look up at the universe,
Some things attract to each other,
Like the planets and stars.

Even though I can't read your mind
You know you think about it all the time,
So what's keeping us apart?

Do you feel what I feel the closer that we get
It's almost like there's a force that we can't resist.

Baby, tell me why, why you wanna stop
What's happening inside it's bigger than you and me,
It's like we're fighting gravity.
Even if we run we'll be like a shadow
Running from the sun, something you can't escape.
It's gonna pull you back to me.
You'll be fighting, fighting, fighting gravity,
Fighting, fighting, fighting gravity,
Fighting, fighting, fighting, fighting gravity.

You gotta hold, you gotta hold, you gotta hold on me,
You gotta hold, you gotta hold, you gotta hold on me,
You gotta hold, you gotta hold, you gotta hold on me,
You gotta hold, you gotta hold, you gotta hold, like gravity.

Baby, tell me why, why you wanna stop
What's happening inside it's bigger than you and me,
It's like we're fighting gravity.
Even if we run we'll be like a shadow
Running from the sun, something you can't escape.

St. Nick by the fireplace dusting off his head with a frown on his face

He said you left the fire burning and I burnt my butt
so now I've learned you've got to turn the fireplace down
so Santa won't get burned

What would I do without someone like you
Without your sexy smile, those ways won't cramp my style
But you made me sweat when you played hard to get
One kiss from your lips though and I forget
That's how you make me feel on the real to real
All I wanna do is be true to you
Don't need the loneliness, to hell with phoniness
I would never leave love out, because I'm all about you, girl

But you can be yourself, come and chill a while
Do your own thing, it won't cramp my style.
And I'll be there goin'right with the flow

Your innocent side, your straightup side
Look we can make you work without the foolish pride
And where would I be without my girl
You know it really doesn't matter, wouldn't trade her for the world.

If You Go Away,"Girl, I just can't live without you
I know I hurt you
That's the last thing I meant to do
Sometimes I can be careless and blind
Can you forgive the fool that I've been?

You know I love you
You're the one thing I have that's true
My life used to be nothing to me
I never want to feel that again

(Chorus)
If you go away girl
You're taking my heart with you
If you go away girl
You'll be breaking my heart in two
If you only stay girl
I promise you the world
So please don't ever go away

You know I need you
I'm so sorry that I made you cry
You are everything good in my life
Your tears have finally opened my eyes

If you go away girl
You're taking my heart with you
If you go away girl
You'll be breaking my heart in two
If you only stay girl
I promise you the world
So please don't ever go away

I was so wrong to ever look at another baby
Even the strongest man can stumble and fall
And I'll do anything for you
Anything to be in your arms again
Baby don't let this be the end
I was so wrong to ever look at another girl

If you go away girl
You're taking my heart with you
If you go away girl

We gotta work it out
Get back what we lost
I see shadows of a doubt,
But I'm keepin'my fingers crossed

She was just turning 17
He always promised her he'd stay
They were so love crazy 'til she had a baby
Then he turned and walked away.


How long will we keep this goin' on
Before we find a way
to care for each other
Living for today, we`ll never see tomorrow.


Chorus


He was just out to get a wreck
He was too proud to show his pain
Someone pulled a trigger guess he never figured
He would lose at his own game.


How long can we keep this goin' on
When no one takes the blame
There's so many gone
We could find a way, it may not be too late.


Chorus


Take a look around, See how hard it is
To survive these days
But sometimes you wonder
How long can this keep goin' on
I guess the only thing you do is keep your fingers crossed


How long will we keep this goin' on
When no one takes the blame
There's so many gone
Livin'for today, we may not see tomorrow

Got you frozen in a frame inside my mind,
How can I forget your smile even for a little while?

Time will heal these scars you made,
Time will give me back my heart again.

How I'm drowning in your memories,
So hard to breathe now that you're gone.

How can I move on when all I do is miss you more
And more, every day I miss you more and more.

I know that I should walk away and close the door,
But how is that possible when you're so beautiful?
And the fire in my heart it burns so bright,
If I don't get you back tonight the flames are gonna touch the sky.

From the very first time I met you, Girl, you captured me
You're my pop-si-cle!
All I know is that you make me feel so fancyfree.

Gonna love you for a lifetime
And I know you're gonna love me too
You make me feel, feel so real

Sweeter than candy
Better than cake
And everytime we kiss
It feels oh so great


Girl, can't you see?
You're the one, you're the one for me!

When I call you up on my favorite party line
You sound so sweet, Girl. You're blowing my mind

Strike a chord like a symphony

Cause you're the one, you're the one
Who can light that spark
Blow it all open

I can only hear the truth

girl, there's more to what I feel inside.
And if I told you, would you be my girl, for you I'd travel round the world.

we've come too far to ever be just friends.
Time is on our side, girl, let's show the whole world,
love is the answer and time is our closest friend.

If I sent you flowers, would you walk away,
or would it be enough to make you stay?

You're running through my veins under my skin,

I know I'll just pass it through,
But now I know my love's wasted on you.

If only I could hate you,
I mean, I try but I just can't.
But maybe I could find you in the arms of another man.

It's the beginning to our end
I'm running out of excuses,
Lying to myself, keep thinking you can change.

Save my love for another, cause it's wasted on you.

God Must Have Spent A Little More Time On You,"Can this be true
Tell me can this be real?
How can I put into words how I feel?
My life was complete
I thought I was whole
Why do I feel like I'm losing control?

Never thought that love could feel like this
And you changed my world with just one kiss
How can it be that right here with me?
Theres an angel
It's a miracle

CHORUS
Your love is like a river,
Peaceful and deep
Your soul is like a secret that I never could keep
When I look into your eyes
I know that its true,
God must have spent a little more time on you

In all of creations all things great and small
You are the one that surpasses them all
More precious than any diamond or pearl
They broke the mold when you came in this world

And I'm trying hard to figure out
Just how I ever did without
The warmth of your smile
The heart of a child
That's deep inside
Makes me purified

CHORUS
Your love is like a river,
Peaceful and deep
Your soul is like a secret that I never could keep
When I look into your eyes
I know that its true,

And you changed my world with just one kiss
How can it be that right here with me?
There's an angel
It's a miracle

Peaceful and deep

To make you come home.
Yeah,
Seems so long ago you walked away,
Left me alone.
And I remember what you said to me,
You were acting so strange. (Hmmm)
And maybe I was too blind to see,
that you needed a change.
Was it something I said,
to make you turn away,
to make you walk out and leave me cold.
If I could just find a way...
to make it so that you were right here,
Right now

Won't you please let me know,
The time is passing so slowly now,
Guess that's my life without you. (Guess that's my life without you)
And maybe I could change my everyday,
But baby, I don't want to.
So I'll just hang around, and find some things to do,
To take my mind off missing you.

No one will ever take your place

Could ever find the perfect foot
I never believed in magic
Or that wishes could come true
But your very first kiss
Changed all this something only you could do

You made me a believer
You made me trust again
You showed me there's a pot of gold
At every rainbow's end

(CHORUS)
I believe in you
I swear that forever from today
No one will ever take your place
I believe in you
And I believe our love will last always

Only love set you free
And if you serve to fate
Then you're my destiny
Now I know
Now I see
Anything can happen
If you just believe

(CHORUS)
I believe in you
I swear that forever from today
No one will ever take your place
I believe in you
And I believe our love will last always

I Thought She Knew,"She was my once in a lifetime

Oh I guess I should have told her
I thought she knew

She said I took her for granted
That's the last thing I would do
Whoa I'll never understand it
I thought she knew
I thought she knew

I thought she knew
My world revolved around her
My love light burned for her alone
But she couldn't see the flame
Only myself to blame
I should have known
I should have known

A heart full of words left unspoken
Now that we're through
I'd sell my soul to have this silence broken
Oh I thought she knew

I thought she knew
My world revolved around her
My love light burned for her alone
But she couldn't see the flame

All I Want Is You This Christmas,"Snowy night
Where it's warm here by the fire
Here with you, I have all that I desire
It's been a long year
But somehow we got by
Now it's Christmas Eve
And love is on our side

I don't need a hundred gifts beneath the tree
Don't you know the best thing you could give to me
Nothing else will do
All I want is you this Christmas

Children sing Christmas carols at our door
Spreading joy
That's what Christmas time is for
Though we don't have much
You've got me and I've got you
And with a little faith miracles come true

I don't need a hundred gifts beneath the tree
Don't you know the best thing you could give to me
Nothing else will do
All I want is you this Christmas

I don't want the love of any other girl
I want only one thing in this whole wide world
Nothing else will do
All I want is you this Christmas

Cheek to cheek
The lights are low
A kiss beneath the mistletoe
Your face lit by the fire's glow
That's all I want tonight

I don't need a hundred gifts beneath the tree
Don't you know the best thing you could give to me
Nothing else will do
All I want is you this Christmas

Nothing else will do
All I want is you this Christmas

You bring
So many magical wonders
To my day

How could I ever leave
One reason why
Cause darlin' without you
I cannot breathe
You're the best thing
In all my life
The only one
Who helps me through
So much pain and strife

Baby you know...
Chorus:
You'll always be in my heart
We'll never have reasons
To ever part
When I look into yor eyes
All I see is you and I
Together, forever in your heart

Darlin' yes
I love you more than words can say

You'll always be mine
No matter where you are
You're always at the front
Of my mind
Only for eternity
You've touched my heart
With undying hope
With your love
My problems can cope
No one will ever take your place
When I close my eyes
I see me
Kissing your sweet face

You're much more beautiful
Than Heaven's glowing embrace
Chorus

You'll alwyas be
Forever with me
Baby, just wait and see
You're my dream come true
And all I can say
Is that I love you

All I can say
Is I love you
Every night and day
My dreams come true
Only when I'm with you
Holding you near

I'll always be
With you, you'll see
Forever, Forever in your heart
Only always

Good morning mister sunshine, you brighten up my day.
Come sit beside me in your way.

Lonely days, lonely nights. Where would I be without my woman?
(Where would I be without my woman?)
Lonely days, lonely nights. Where would I be without my woman?

And how can you mend a broken heart?
How can you stop the rain from falling down?
How can you stop the sun from shining?
What makes the world go round?
How can you mend a this broken man?
How can a loser ever win?
Please help me mend my broken heart and let me live again.

How deep is your love

Cause we're living in a world of fools
breaking us down when they all should let us be
we belong to you and me.
Da DA Da....
How deep is your love

Well, you can tell by the way I use my walk
I'm a woman's man, no time to talk.
Music loud and women warm,
I've been kicked around since I was born.
And now it's all right, it's okay,
you may look the other way.
We can try to understand
the New York Times' effect on man.

Whether you're a brother or whether you're a mother
you're stayin' alive, stayin' alive.
Feel the city breakin' and everybody shakin'
and you're stayin' alive, stayin' alive.
Ah, ah, ah, ah, stayin' alive, stayin' alive,

Holding them back

I thought we'd get to see tomorrow

But I'm only human
Branded by my ambitions
But I'm going to make it count

With an open heart and mind

In life I could have followed
But one of those paths must lead to your heart

Home For Christmas,"Crossing the ocean with my window view.

Making out their wish list,
All dressed up for Christmas.

On my own for too many years,

I miss the tears.

When I close my eyes,
and I'm all alone.
I think of all the love we shared.
When I need a friend,
Or a helping hand,
I know that you will all be there.
I've been gone for so many holidays.
But you can light the fire,
Cause this year, (this year)
I'll be home for Christmas Day.

I see the children playing in the snow,
Precious memories I used to know.
Then I see the love in a mother's eyes,
Always there to teach us,
The real meaning of Christmas.
On my own for too many years,
I miss the happiness.
I miss the tears.

When I close my eyes,

I Never Knew The Meaning Of Christmas,"Fa la la Fa la la Fa la la la la la

Lookin back on childhood days
I can't believe my foolish ways
Thought that Christmas only came from the stores
And to know what was there for me,
Underneath the Christmas tree
Didn't know that there could be so much more
But in all of the rush
I was missin so much
Girl, you make me finally see

(Chorus:)
I never knew the meaning of Christmas
Till you came into my life
I was lost in the dark
Till you opened my heart
Like an angel shining bright
I wished on a star
And girl here you are
Suddenly I realize
That I never knew the meaning of Christmas
Until I looked into your eyes

Comin home for the Holidays
Seein friends from around the way
There was always something missin for me
On a sleigh ride caroling
Did it really mean anything?
Without that someone who can make it complete
While the snow's fallin down,
There was joy all around
Cuz girl, your love has shown me the way

I still remember the things that you said
I keep your words alive, I could never forget

So proud that I could know you
Told the world it's time that they believed in you
You stood for right and truth

And you should know
Some say it wasn't worth the things we went through (things we went through)
I say it ain't worth losing you(losing you)

We've got to keep remembering

Stand up if you believe in it
You've got to face the world, be strong

You have sleepin in the same bed, er'night

Go rock with me, you deserve the best
Take a few shots
Let it burn in your chest
We could ride down
Pumpin N.E.R.D. in the deck
Funny how a few words turn into sex
Play this free, joint called ""brain""

Make me suerve in the lane
The name Malicious
And I burn every track

Love's In Our Hearts On Christmas Day,"Mmm oooo

I know great distance still remains between us
But there's good reason to hold on
It's the happiest time of the year
Filled with laughter and good cheer
As you watch the snow
Sweet love, you'll hear me say

Chorus:
You've got my heart on Christmas
Inside my soul, your love remains
Love's in our hearts on Christmas day

The days and weeks and months go by so slowly
We are both wishing it would fly oh
As the night begins to fall
Twilight drowns the bedroom cheer
Such a rush with joy (rush with joy)
And love, it comforts me
And I do believe

Chorus 2:
Love's in our hearts on Christmas
Though far apart
As one we pray
Love's in our hearts on Christmas day

A snowflake melts
In your eye it turns to a tear
But your cheek, it stays dry
With your warm smile so near
I have no fear
We're gonna make it
Ooo, ooo, ooo, ooo

Amongst the tourists in a crowded room
I took her walking on the sandy beaches
Under a silver Carribean moon

And till this day I can still picture it
She took my hand
And I took her kiss
So temporary these moments of bliss

Some dreams just fade away
Like yesterday's sunset
Some dreams are made to stay
She's one dream I'll never forget
Everyday just seemed to go too quickly
And ever night just passed us in a blur
I never noticed the blue skies and waters
Because I only had eyes for her
And so when she promised that
And I promised this
And to this day I can still picture it
She took my hand
And I took her kiss
So temporary these moments of bliss

Please make me lucky enough

You must be heaven sent

I forget to speak
Something happens when you kiss my mouth

Could it be true this is what God has meant for me
Cause baby I can't believe something like you
Could happen to me

All your secrets I will learn
Even if it takes forever

Was to certain poor shepherds in fields where they lay
In fields where they lay keeping their sheep
On a cold winter's night

Shining in the east beyond them far
And to the herd
It gave grand light
And so it continued both day and night

They spied, the light of that same star

Game over, game
You lose

Game over, game

Oh yeah
Oh yeah

You lose

Invincible, is what you think you are
But you're just so typical
Don't you think that you're a star
You act like everyone revolves around you
Baby, you dropped the ball
And now the game is through

'Cause you tried to play both sides
(both sides)
You got caught up in your lies
(In your lies)
But you're running, you're running out of time

You played yourself (Game over, game)
But did you did you think that you would really find love
from someone else (Game over,game)
You're making moves, you're gonna lose, you know
You played yourself (Game over, game)
And now you're thinkin', thinkin' you can get one by me
But you'll never win, but you'll never win
Try again, 'cause the game is over

The game is over

Take it personal 'cause I did when you cheated on me
You may be beautiful
But there's more that the eye can't see
You're so predictable
The way you calculate each move
Heads I win, tails you lose because you don't have the right to choose

'Cause you tried to play both sides
(Both sides)
You got caught in all your lies
(In your lies)
And now you're running, you're running out of time (yeah)

But you'll never win, but you'll never win
Try again, 'cause the game is over (yeah)

Uh
Whoo!

How could you think that you could do me like that?
Running behind my back
How could you do me like that? (do me like that)
Now the game is over (oh)
How could you think you could do me like that?
Do me like that?
Do me like that?
Uh!

Played yourself (Game over, game) (oh)
But did you did you think that you would really find love

The Only Gift,"I was makin my list
I was checkin it twice
In the middle of this, I got tears in my eyes
For in my foolish heart, there was one simple truth
The only gift I wanted was you
I was trimming the tree
I was stringing the lights
While the radio played ""Silent Night""
There were presents you sent
Though there were quite a few
The only gift I wanted was you

(Chorus:)
You need to be home with me
Alone with me
Holding me next to the Christmas tree
Kissing under the mistletoe
As candles glow
Please come home soon
It's not the same without you

As the bitter-sweet night had come to an end
I was saying goodbye to our family and friends
And they all wished me well
And I knew that I knew
The only gift I wanted was you

(Chorus)

Deck the halls with boughs of holly
Fa la la la la la la
Ohhhhh, Ohhhhh
The only gift I wanted was you

(Chorus)

I was makin my list
I was checkin it twice

Hanging out at the spot
You know the place we go
The music's John Blaze hot
And everybody was feeling the DJ
Smoke cleared and I saw a beautiful lady
The lights went low and the disco ball came down
She walked up to me slow and you know what happens now
The girl was fine and she knew she had game
What more do I have to say

She took my hand
We never said a word at all

She already had me up against the wall

Is where I'm going to
'Cause I gotta have some more
Looking for somebody to hit the dance floor
And lucky for me I see a fine young lady's eyeing me
The lights are low and her friends were all around
I walked up to her so and you know what happens now
She turned around and she worked it the worst way
What more do I have to say

She took my hand
We never said a word at all
We started grinding
She already had me up against the wall
Ask me about tomorrow
You know that I don't care at all
I just got caught up when she had me up against the wall
She already had me up against the wall

Mirror mirror on the wall, who's the cutest one you saw?
She's underneath the disco ball. The disco ball? The disco ball.
Standing next to strobe lights, dancin' hot, lookin' tight
The freaks sure do come out at night, out at night, night, night, night
What more (whoo) do I have to say

Now angels are falling from your skies

And I haven?t held you for so long

Why did we tell all those lies

On this Christmas baby, you don?t have to be alone

And I had only one wish on my list
For me you would be the perfect gift
There?s nothing colder than an empty home
(empty home)
And holidays were never meant to be alone
(to be alone)
The smiles we gave when our hearts were saved
By each others? love and warmth
That's subsided now no happiness around
If I can only find a way to your heart

Outside the wind it seems so cold
Your heart is frozen like the snow
And there?s no one home to keep you safe and warm
Your eyes are red because you?ve cried
You fell asleep by the fireside
but there?s one thing you should know

I Took a Pill In Ibiza,"I took a pill in Ibiza
To show Avicii I was cool

felt 10 years older

I drive a sports car just to prove
I'm a real big baller
cause I made a million dollars
And I spend it on girls and shoes

I get along with old timers

of a pop song people forgot
And I can't keep a girl, no
Cause as soon as the sun comes up
I cut 'em all loose and work's my excuse

I brought my pride and my guitar
All my friends are all gone
but there's manicured lawns
And the people still think I'm a star
I walked around downtown
I met some fans on Lafayette
They said ""Tell us how to make it
'cause we're getting real impatient""
So I looked 'em in the eye and said

Hold on to whatever helps you through
Hold on to whatever you find baby
I don't trust myself with loving you

I do my best to act like she doesn't phase me
As if I pull girls just like her all the time
I even waited seven days before I called her
But she can play this game much better than I

See I've got girls in every state, now they hate me
Cause I'm leavin just as fast as I came
And if my past is any sign of my future
I'll probably end up not remembering her name

Hold on to whatever you find baby
Hold on to whatever helps you through
Hold on to whatever you find baby
I don't trust myself with loving you

She deserves better
Better better
Better than me
Better than me
That she deserves better
Better better
Better than me
Better than me
That she deserves better
Better than me
That she deserves better
Better than me

Hold on to whatever you find baby
Hold on to whatever helps you through
Hold on to whatever you find baby

Miley Cyrus,"[Verse 1]
When I was a young man I carried my pack
And lived the free life of the rover
I smoked on sativa, guitar on my back
And played my little songs all over

[Pre-Chorus 1]
But in 2010, my country said: ""son
It's time to stop rambling, there's work to be done""
And they gave me a tin hat, and they gave me a gun
And they shipped me away to the war

[Chorus]
And the Dj played Miley Cyrus
A Party in the Usa
And the Dj played Miley Cyrus
And we flew to the Afghan that day

[Verse 2]
I remember the day our orders came in
I was scared and my stomach was sinking
And when Martinez got shot, I cried with my gun
And I fired right back without blinking

[Pre-Chorus 2]
And we moved down the range, we pumped ourselves well
We chased them with bullets
And we showered them with shells
And in ten minutes flood we blown them to hell
I thought of my mom in Atlanta

[Chorus]
Cause she always loved Miley Cyrus
A Party In The Usa
Though the words seemed to take on new meaning
As I turned nineteen on that day

[Verse 3]
I looked at my brothers who'd once been young boys
And their eyes have gone black from the slaughters
And for ten weary weeks I kept myself for life
As we moved down the range towards the water

[Pre-Chorus 3]
But then one day a shell knocked my ass over head
And when I woked up in my hospital bed
And when I saw what it had done I wished I was dead
I never knew there were worse things than dying

[Chorus]
And the nurses hummed Miley Cyrus
As the doctors explained what was wrong
Yeah, the nurses hummed Miley Cyrus
But I no longer cared for that song

[Verse 4]
They collected the wounded, the crippled, the maimed
And they sent us all home to Atlanta
The armless, the legless, the blind and the insane
I wore fatigues and a blood red bandana

[Pre-Chorus 4]
We landed on the same runway we'd lefted on February
And when I looked down where my legs used to be
I thanked God that no one was waiting for me
To grieve and to mourn and to pity

[End-Chorus]
And the Dj played Miley Cyrus, again
A Party In The Usa
And no one cheered they just stared at us
And slowly turned their heads away
Yes, they slowly turned their heads away",Mike Posner,Pop

Good mornin'
This that alarm clock song
I made it for you to wake up to
Ah!

You know I came to rip the scene apart
My whole life is a piece of art (Oh)
And this is just a brush stroke (Oh)
I made it in the biz they said was cutthroat (Oh)
I'm gettin' where I wanna be but honestly
I can't even tell if that's really where I wanna be
I'm not a commodity, I am on an Odyssey
Used to be a wannabe
Now I'm what I wanted to be, woah
I'm an underdog, dog, I'm Ralph Naderin'
Followin' my intuition now and that's a major win
I'm Taylor Swift mixed with Ruth Bader Gins'
Liberation is the flavor that I'm savorin', it's mm
Fake breast and make-up they don't turn me on
Life is a game and yes the journey's long
Growing my beard was just like me puttin' my jersey on
Coach K saw the light in me early on

(Oh, you don't believe?)
(Mike Posner, boy, is he talented
I mean he's so talented)
(What up, Nolan?)
(John, go get 'em, woah!)

We 'bout to take it to a new level
Even when I'm sad I give 'em hell, I'ma Blue Devil
Her boyfriend wrote a book, I was unimpressed
I don't care about her man if it wasn't Hesse (Oh)
I might do Everest, you never know (Oh)
It changes like a metronome (Oh)
I never read the ""Untethered Soul"" (Oh)
I already got an untethered soul (Oh)
I wasted years tryna become better known (Oh)
Right when I gave that up is when I became better known (Oh)
Oh, this is that Michigan December flow
I got two lifetimes worth of ideas in my Evernote (Oh)
Bozo, Fender Rhodes (Oh)
Complimented outwardly now from my inner glow (Oh)
And since I've seen
I changed my look to see who really loves me
I'm Prince Akeem

See when I was comin' up
I was always one of them niggas who did what the fuck I want
Smokin' weed on TV wasn't even cool
Now that shit legal
So back then
From causing trouble
To right now
I'm a motherfuckin' businessman

Uh, too rich to ever fit in
You wait the front, I get in
You talk too much, I listen
You blind, I got the vision
The day I worked for myself, that was the best decision
You living' check to check
I check to see what checks I'm gettin'
You get no respect until respect is given
I live with no regret, you regret where you livin'
Still got the yellow car, we in the house chillin'
You think the air is on, I'm heir to the throne
So many diamonds people stare when I put 'em on
But they don't walk up, my pockets thick like Ms. Parker
And I got the Benz parked, sparkin' up
And I got a '64 that's hard as fuck
But don't get in over your head
Supposed to be stackin'
Instead of spendin' most of your bread
Don't get in over your head
Supposed to be stackin'

Can't you just stay a little bit longer?
Can't you just stay one more night, right?

The girls love, they see me stunting on
Ellen, Kathy Lee and Regis

The shoes you wore in your video, I wear them shits to open
I do it like get on the plane, walk on the plane,
get off the plane, go
Do the same, every day, I'm gonna play my own
I don't know why every night them girls be trying to bang

I used to be a favorite rappers' favorite singer
before I had the plaques
Now I'm the only singer that your favorite rapper's scared of
cause I burn 'em on the track
I know you seen my video, your girl got my shit on replay
and that shit that you wore in yours that's my fucking PJs
Live on the plane, walk off the plane, every single night
Step on the stage, up in the rage whenever we head inside
I don't know why every night them girls be trying to bang
I'm just trying to do my thang like

A Lonely Night In Mexico Thinking About Big Sean and Avicii,"And start-up agian. Umm, I think it'll be an experience
for you that, you'll never forget
Probably, with your life changing
I think it's going to be very hard on your body
I think you're gonna be, umm, shocked at how difficult it is
But I applaud you for trying it
I'm really excited for you. And I [?] so nobody gets hurt
So just be safe. And I love you

It's hard to explain what I got the vision for
It's almost like I'm tryna sing a hidden note
And I can't even get it out though it's it my throat
I get so frustrated, I feel like a misanthrope
I start feeling like my whole life isn't dope
And I've ruined everything with what I didn't know
And some shit my father told, it starts hitting home
What the fuck am I here livin' for?
I miss my friends, we don't talk as much as we used to
I'm too busy checking on Youtube, and scrolling on Ig
I tend to get glued to various distractions as my life floats by
Have I just been checked out the whole time?
I spend 85 of it online
And for the things that really matter I got no time (No time)
But wait, if I can get myself out of this broke mood
Then maybe all my listeners could have hope too
Yeah, that's what I'm gon' do
I become who I am from all the shit I go through

Keep walkin'
If I could write my name across the sky for all to see
Then I would, if I could bring myself to understand
what you are, then I would
And I would, if I could, if I could, then I would
And I would, if I could, if I could, then I would
And I would, if I could, if I could, then I would
And I would, if I could, if I could, then I would, and I would

I'ma butterfly flyin' through a broken sky
God servin' me truth, and I'm open wide
And it takes courage to be still and go inside
I'm on a tip of liberation, watch me toe the line
When a yoga pose hits a yoga pose
A part of me that I really hate showin' shows
You get a taste from my post of quotes
But my inner growth is something no one knows
And I hope it shows
In my eyes, in my music, in my vibe, in my kindness
And in my stride, in the grand art piece that is my life
And again, this is just a brush stroke
You've been running long enough, child, come home
Break it down, universe means one song
You wanna taste life, swim into the unknown
I know that I did my best
I'm not designed to eat, sleep, sit, and text
But thirty-first year is a vision quest
I know the answer I'm lookin' for isn't sex
And it isn't money, isn't fame
It's something much deeper than I can't explain
And this verse is just a finger pointin' towards the trail
Soon you gonna have to walk it for yourself

Keep walkin'
If I could write my name across the sky for all to see
Then I would, if I could bring myself to understand
what you are, then I would
And I would, if I could, if I could, then I would
And I would, if I could, if I could, then I would
And I would, if I could, if I could, then I would
And I would, if I could, if I could, then I would, and I would

If you could give a wish to future Mike
when he sets off to his walk in a few months
what would that be?
I wish you remember this is what you wanted
This is, this is what you wanted
I understand intellectually
there gonna be terrible moments on this journey
where I'll wanna give up, where my body hurts
where I'm thinking
""Why the heck did I choose to do this?
This was so stupid. "" And the reason you chose to do it
was to feel what you're feeling right now
and decide to keep going",Mike Posner,Pop

You probably hear it everyday
You know you don't belong here
With normal people doing normal things

So push your problems in your impending fame
Push 'em away, yeah, push 'em away

A Perfect Mess,"So what's a young man to do
Had a million in the bank when I turned 22, alright
It might've saved me
Doing impressions of myself
So people say it hasn't changed me
If only that were true now
But ain't a artist in the game
That can do what I do.
I ain't your little secret no more
But listen real close, and I give you one more

See, all of these American dreams,
That I find myself living out
Mixed with all of these man-made woman
That I find myself digging out
They tell me all day long to get a bodyguard
To help myself get around
But I ain't ever been afraid of people getting inside,
I'm more afraid of what I got on the inside, getting out
And what was left, a perfect mess
Did we forget? A perfect mess
And what was left, a perfect mess
Did we forget?

Been a while since 09
Remember when I told you
It was it was a matter of time
Did you believe me? Did it take this long?
I told Sean if I ever got on that I'd
Never ever buy a chain with ice
And I didn't
Before this all changed my life,
From dreams in the dorm room to doing big things
In the boardroom

See, all of these non-American bottles
That I find myself sipping out
Mixed with all of the things I'mma have to relearn
How to one day live without.
Mixed all of the things inside my head
I can't figure out

But I ain't ever been afraid of people seeing inside,
I'm more afraid of what I got on the inside, getting out
And what was left, a perfect mess
Did we forget, a perfect mess

Said her favorite song last year was ""Blaming it on the Alcohol""

At the end of day she realize
I'm a young nigga just livin life

Be As You Are,"Virginia Woolf and poetry
No one seemed to notice me
Being young was getting so old
Cheap beer and cigarettes
Life was like a movie set
And I seemed to be given no role

But in times of trouble
I can turn to my mother
And I know that she gon' understand
So at age 18
I cried to my mother
And she told me, ""young man""

""There are moments when you fall to the ground
But you are stronger than you feel you are now
You don't always have to speak so loud, no
Just be as you are
Life is not always a comfortable ride
Everybody's got scars that they hide
And everybody plays the fool sometimes, yeah
Just be as you are""

They played me on the radio
And everything was changing, so
I thought I was all the way grown
But I can still remember in that cold November
When I realized I'm all alone
But in times of trouble
I can turn to my mother
And I know that she gon' understand
So at age 22
I cried to my mother
And she told me, ""young man""

""There are moments when you fall to the ground
But you are stronger than you feel you are now
You don't always have to speak so loud, no
Just be as you are
It doesn't matter if you become some star
Life is better when you open your heart
You don't always have to act so hard, no
Just be as you are""

If I'm speaking truthfully
I'm not who I used to be
And I know some people might laugh
Cause my music doesn't sound the same
And my head's no longer shaved
I'm worried if I'm on the right path

But in times of trouble
I can turn to my mother
And I know that she gon' understand
So at age 26

Buried In Detroit,"I'm a writer and a lover
I'm a midwest music man
And I've been to a lot of places
But I'm gon' end where I began
I took class in carolina
Got high smoking joints
And now they know my name in paris

But I'll be buried in detroit
Next to my father, and my father's father too
I used to live in new york city
But baby that ain't no substitute
Not for my hometown
That place people avoid
I've made love in every city
But I'll be buried in detroit

I don't claim to be a prophet
I just speak my mind
I try to tell it like it is
And sometimes God makes it rhyme
I like my songs how I like my women
Honest and to the point
You see I got fucked up in stockholm

But I'll be buried in detroit
Next to my father, my father's father too
Had a spot in new york city
But baby that ain't no substitute
Not for my hometown
That place people avoid
I've made love in every city
But I'll be buried in detroit

You know I ain't gon' live forever
Baby it won't be long
At the wake they'll say ""he made a lot of mistakes
But he could write hell of a song""
And I made, I made killing
Though I never really was employed
I had a girl from san diego

'Cause didn't talk to nobody, just made beats
And now I get paid by the syllable
Gotta thank 'em though I know it can be difficult
As I tip-toe into another zip code
All on the mission to love, that's what I live for
I got big dreams, ma, I got big goals
You seen my old ones now because I live those
You've gotta admit ma
I told you I was gonna get into the duke, ma
And I did, ma
I told you I'd get signed and I did, ma
Look at this, ma, look at this, ma!

""Fuck bitches, "" it's what my favorite rappers would say
I'd say there's something beautiful after the pain
After the pain, this can't be real
Turn out the ladder to fame
Isn't a hamster wheel
When we played the place my parents would first roll
That's a feeling that I don't even have words for
I did my song [?] backstages and drinking Henny bottle
Pick up the phone and then I started texting any model
I used to put target on every cute face
And keep playing B-Pills in my suitcase
""That's gross, time to grow, "" that's what Ronny said
Man, Wille just called, ""Dwag, Ronny's dead""

I might pop up in your city, dog, you never know
And don't forget change, it's like a metronome
And the beard is like war paint
Duke Game is my only court date
Outside all year, walkin' towards faith
My North face is in [?]
They shouldn't never let me read Barhaze
The breakup hit me in a sore place
This is now a one horse race
Everybody love me like my name is King George Strait, woo

I think I got angels watching
My life just keeps on unlocking
I'm gonna make it to the other side
I think I got angels watching, woah",Mike Posner,Pop
Gone In September,"I used to be a sweetheart
I used to be alright
I'd tell myself I love you
But I'm creeping every night
When I met you at the party
And I told you you were pretty
I was honestly just trying to score

But you made me wait a week
Just to kiss you in the cheek
Now it's breaking my heart to break yours

I said I loved you in the summer
But will I love you in the fall
I thought I wasn't like the others
Guess I'm an asshole after all

Come September I'll be Gone (gone, gone, gone)
Come September I'll be Gone (gone, gone, gone)

I used to be a good guy
I used to be alright
I'd tell myself I loved you
But I'm creeping every night
When I met you at the party
When I told you you were pretty
I was honestly just trying to score

I said I loved you in the summer
But will I love you in the fall
I thought I wasn't like the others
Guess I'm an asshole after all

Come September I'll be Gone (gone, gone, gone)
Come September I'll be Gone (gone, gone, gone)

I'd be lying if I said it didn't feel right
I've been trying
But I cant just get the feeling back
When did I become?
The Bad Guy

I said I loved you in the summer
I loved you in the summer
But will I love you in the fall
Lo-love you in the fall

I thought I wasn't like the others
I Wasn't like the others
Guess I'm an asshole after all

Come September I'll be gone",Mike Posner,Pop

Heaven,"To the families of the December 14th tragedy

Today, we shed our tear for you
Tomorrow, we do it all again
They say that time will make it better
I think about what could have been

Still, I believe that there's whole lot of good people
I believe that there's a life
I believe in more than things I can see, my love
And I know this isn't right

But maybe this will make sense in heaven
And I will understand why you gone
Maybe this will make sense in heaven
Cause right now it don't make sense at all

Today, my prayers are in the sky
Tomorrow, they'll still be there for you
They say that time will make it better
Now I hope that what they say is true

Cause I believe that there's whole lot of good people
And I believe that there's a life
And I believe in more than things I can see, my love

Just because I stand on the stage now
Just because I'm ill in the booth
Doesn't mean that I can't really love you
If you listen then I'll tell you the truth

I'm getting kinda tired of
Well, I spare you the details
But I got a little crazy with the females
The last whore, okay
And the one before but I'm tryna tell you
I don't think I want that no more, I guess
At least you know that I've got the experience
So when you're cool with it
You know I know what to do with it
Everything that you'd expected the most
Sex on the shower, on the bed, sex on the floor
But burns on my knees, scratches on my back
You put those on my body to remind me to come back (hehehe)
And for some reasons I do
I even eat it, but that's a secret just between me and you

Let's take it back to the basics
Looking for love in all the wrong places
All up in the party sipping on ciroq
I was coming at the women when I was spending big faces
Every night I'm in the zone doing what ever I want to do
In the hotel lobby like you and you and you
Untill I met you
May Twist got the urge
Gotta get with you cause I was sick with the world
Looking at you cause the picture was perfect
No other chick make it to the kicked to the curb
Sit cause I got a trip on the wheel
Was looking everywhere for love and I found it right here
I'm Twista, getting ready to know ya
It was Mike Posner who's making it quite clear
You the only one

And some sunshine in my pocket
It was how you used words I didn't know
And the way you said my name
And cut up peaches and them brown eyes
Little flame that we pretend doesn't glow

Wouldn't let you be mine

And I'm wrapped around your finger
Even though I'm knocked up

Iris,"If I could be just one thing
I would be what you're craving
Six foot three with steel blue eyes
Sweep you off of your feet before you count to five
But the truth is I am just a man
Standing five foot ten doing the best I can
And I've lived long enough to see
You will never be craving me

Oh whoa
I watched her go
After she planted her love in the top soil
And from the top soil an iris bloomed
It was pretty in May, but it died in June

If I could sing the way I feel inside
It'd sound happy and sad at the same damn time
'Cause when you smiled at me on that dance floor
It was the prettiest mask that you ever wore

Oh whoa
I watched her go
After she planted her love in the top soil
And from the top soil an iris bloomed
It was pretty in May, but it died in June

Cuts her nails with a razor blade
Says she lives by no one's law
Ran my pride through a big chainsaw
Have you heard of D. B. Cooper?
I got pulled over by an old state trooper
I met a girl, her name was Jade
She cut my face with a razor blade

Yeah, I screamed out in fury
Yeah, but my cries were not heard
Yeah, the judge and the jury
Yeah, they could offer no cure

[Verse 2]
I met a girl, her name was Jade
She got a brand new man and they got engaged
The wedding's gon' be on a big green hill
They hope it won't rain but it probably will
The man, he was a football star
He broke his knee, now he sells cars
Only so much that words can do
Love was blind, but they cured that, too
You know, Gandhi has a son our age
He said the freedom thing's just one big cage
I met a girl, her name was Jade
Her husband died, but she kept his name

Yeah, she screamed out in fury
Yeah, but her cries were not heard
Yeah, her mom was so worried
Yeah, but she could offer no cure

Boss man calls for a meeting at noon
Big cigar in an oak board room
We got an idea and we think it's great
Said it was too much so we're gonna try eight
Who made love to Scarlet Jo?
And where the hell did Josh Hartnett go?
I met a girl, her name was Jade
Lived her whole damn life in a mascaraed

Yeah, I screamed out in fury

Yeah, they said I'll never see 30

My sister smoked 'em, I didn't see the point
And everyone keeps sayin' that I look just like you
Life don't seem so alone anymore

The day my daddy died, I damn near quit the band
The day my daddy died, I held my mama's hand
I cried my tears, then dried 'em up
Put my face inside my hands
The day my daddy died, I became a man

The cops came, they did not take off their shoes
People hug me, I smell like 10, 000 perfumes
Gave away the wheelchair, you're gone, but I'm still here
January in Detroit is cold as fuck

I cried my tears, then dried 'em up
Put my face inside my hands
The day my daddy died, I became a man
The day my daddy died, I became a man

I love you, too
Remind me to let you run away if you need to run places, like the basement. I mean, that's what it's a part, isn't it? Being an individual

Legacy (With Talib Kweli),"(Legacy)
I can see the future

I know who I am

I think I can feel my
(Legacy)
Lega-lega-legacy

Legacy, is when you need no introductions
You walk in the room and everybody start buzzin'
Legacy, when your reputation precedes you
Little kids grow up, they wanna be you
Legacy in when you silent but your presence felt
The product like drugs 'cause it sell itself
Yeah, you survived many disasters
And now they hang your jersey from the rafters
And see these jokers gettin' greedier?
Gotta hit the road when the locals don't believe in ya
My music in museums is timeless as Mona Lisa, bruh
A legacy artist, I don't need social media
So when you see me online I'm havin' fun, trust
Unjust situations make me wanna gun-bust
But I'm a man of peace and so I plan to be poetic
With my words to help curb and understand the beast
We keep it all love in the nightclub
They wanna turn the nightclub into the fight club
My life's blood runs deeper than a knife cut
This the crack that the dope boys slice up
My lyrics sound scary to the corporate sellers
I'm like '97 Rockafella but more Griselda
My observations make your heart stop like organ failure
So they think that I could see the future like a fortune teller

(Legacy)
I can see the future

I know who I am

I think I can feel my

Lega-lega-legacy

Heat-check, deep breath
I give all my love to ya, baby, Keith Sweat
Gimme more 20 more miles, I don't need rest
I'm half way to goals I haven't even dreamed yet
And I don't need money, I need faith
People thinking that I'm some sort of DJ
But I'm a poet and a man and a troubadour
I'm divine light hidden in a human form
It doesn't matter what you do, it's what you do it for
There are some places that you can't take an Uber toward
Love people, keep a brave heart
Don't make guns, make art
I got Sequoia trees cheerin' me on
Where ever I am is where I belong
Some of my fam' is buried and gone
I'm tryna learn more things I can share in my songs
Like life is a curtain that hides the divine
You can peak behind that when you quiet the mind
I rely on something that's stronger than me
And all my songs will live much longer than me
That's

Look What I've Become (Ft. Ty Dolla $ign),"Walked across Ohio, took me fifty days
I talked to the stars, they were happy that I came
Somedays I'm a genius, others I'm insane
There is something gorgeous underneath the pain

I can feel it liftin' (Woo) I'm feeling good
I'm thinkin' 'bout David from my old neighborhood
A warm and perfect white light in each of my cells
I used to be a pop singer now I am myself

Yeah, I take a little right now just to count my blessings
Count my blessings, count, count, count
Take a little time right now just to count my blessings
Count my blessings, okay

Even when I'm fallin' there's something underneath
Something that is perfect, it's almost like a dream
I know Vincent Van Gogh, I know Princess Di
And David Foster Wallace he calls me all the time
If I think 'bout paradise I'd imagine this
No drugs or no alcohol 'cause I'm high as it is
I don't want your money, I am simply done
I just walked away, huh, look what I've become

Look what I've become (Woo)
Look what I've become (Woo)
Look what I've become (Woo)
Look what I've become

Rolling through South Central, better watch your ass
Bars all on my window, pistol on my bed-stand
To live and die in L. A. , couldn't make it off of minimum wage
I had to get the big body Mercedes
Cop a Rollie plus one for my lady, my lady
I always knew I'd be a legend, saw it in my dreams
I had to keep one eye open, I could barely sleep
I had to kill 'em with success like they the enemy
Murder, murder, murder, Lord, mercy me
I stopped smoking last year, fuck that, started back again
God don't make no accidents, look what I've become

Losing My Mind,"[Verse 1:]
It's 3: 45 tell me I'm Okay thoughts flying in and out my head
It's 4: 45 I'm still awake staring at this ceiling in my bed
Hand on my solo
That's almost empty
Everybody loves me
Hit me with Benzes
But who I tryin' to kid now
Need to put this shit down
People I don't even know tell me how to live now

I'm Lost On A Road
But no one even cares
No one left to call
No one even there

Walking around
Looking for a way
But no one tells me which way to go
There's people around
People say my name
But some how I'm still all alone
Hand me a cigarette
Don't care bout no cancer
Call up my girl friend
She doesn't answer
So I'm own my own now
Green in this bowl now
Pedal to floor now
I need to slow down

No one left to call
No one even there

I wasn't supposed to be a star
No one ever told me there'd be nights like these, no
I just wanna smoke with my friends in the park
Like we used to
Now I'm drivin' down Melrose
Shit is really kinda feeling
like a hell-hole (And I don't know)
Where did all my friends go?
Tell me where did all my friends go

This is what you listen to in the Marauder
When you don't give a fuck about anything
This is what you listen to in the Marauder
This is the soundtrack to the game, game, game

I don't need no Rolls Royce, or a Bentley
Cause none of my heroes had those
I wonder if I'm supposed to do like them and die young
Cause now I'm someone else's hero
(I drive slow)
Now I'm drivin' through my hometown
The one that every time I go, I always hold down

And now it's feelin' like a ghost town

Mike Meets Blackbear at Joe's Falafel,"But I'm thinkin' to myself that ""Weaponry"" is wack and corny
Halfway through it starts to bore me
Kind of a knock-off of Leonard Cohen's style
Noelle on my mind, we ain't spoken in a while
Jessie J offers me a J
I ain't smoked one in a while
I say okay, I took it and smile
But now I'm just sad and high
I thank her for the session and we say goodbye
I pack up my laptop and my hard drives
My microphone compressor and my guitar I'm
Meetin' bear at Joe's Falafel
[?] there's no falafel
Too many agents, too many managers
People sayin' words just to fill up all the calendars
That's why I moved from L. A
To get away from all thе bad ideas people tеll me
Like

You should take it easy
Baby, you should take it easy

So I'm in an Uber Black 'cause I wanna impress
Mr. blackbear I know will be very well-dressed
And if we take a photo then I wanna look dope, uh
I need all the hoes DMing Mike Posner
My ego's hard to tame
My fame remains the best card to play
Text from blackbear, ""where are you? ""
Well, I'm not that far away
But the 101's slammed, so it's hard to say
How long before I pull up so I pull up
The poem on my iPhone I was workin' on earlier today
And try to make some headway

To whom it may concern (that's a good opening)
Right before the sky gets too tired to hold up the stars (that's a nice line)
Right before virtual reality becomes realer than real reality (that's really shitty writing)
Right before we smoke ourselves out and the oceans turn black

And by the time I finish it up, I've arrived
Noelle's on my mind, maybe I should try
To call her up, let down my defense
Nah, I need to just listen to my friends
When they tell me

You should take it easy
Baby, you should take it easy

So I walk in 20 minutes late
Bear's waitin' with a little funny look upon his face
And he says ""you look like a cancer patient""
I remember I'm bald, now he's testin' my patience
He reads my face and sees I don't think it's funny
""What's up with you, man, sad with all that money?
You ride around in open limousines lookin' like Jimmy Dean
Feelin' clean, Rag and Bone, you got the winnin' genes""
I hear what he's sayin' but it's not effective
I can't see things from his perspective
""You know, I know what you need
Look at me, don't text
Some brand new pussy will get your mind off your ex""
Thank you, Dr. blackbear for breakin' me down
But my L. A. girls all hate me now
'Cause I moved to Detroit I don't reply to texts
So I doubt that they're gonna retry the sex
""Doesn't matter, here's what we're gonna do
You gotta big mansion that you're stayin' in, true? "" (True)
""You throw a big party, I'll invite models
And you know Diddy, free Ciroc bottles! ""
But I hate L. A. parties
""It'll feel like Cabo
You need this, dog, you're lookin' high-low""
He's right, I need it, he's not lyin'
But what about the house, man? It's not mine

You should take it easy
(""This gonna be fun. In fact, it's gonna be better than fun"")
Baby, you should take it easy
(""This is gonna be amazing. You hear me? Amazing. "")

But the cleaner fee, who's gonna pay that shit?
""Did you really just say that? Dude, you're rich!

Feel the earth wake up
Wont stay still
Haters all around, but I wont stay trill
All up in my face trying to show their skill
Say they don't love, but I know they will
Before the show is over and the lights go out
After I rec on the mic show out
Married to the mob, so wives throw out

And I'm just hoping that is true

Just hoping I ain't number two
So, you ask how I feel. I'm fine
You ask about the deal in time

On enough now

My Light,"All I wanted was a record deal
A couple dollars when I got it
I couldn't understand
Why I still had all my problems
All alone, couldn't find no help
And the stage ain't a good place to find yourself
So I started lifting weights
Hoping if I got bigger
All my confidence would too
Didn't work, go figure
Big ole' chest, hole in my heart
I even bought a chain
With ice to glow in the dark
But it didn't work though
Interrupt my work flow
And them niggas talked shit
And I took it personal
But today, I feel like
Someone answered my prayers
I know it's coming now so it's cool

To what's underneath

Like I'm supposed to
Like I'm made for

If you chase the wrong shit your whole life wrong

Noah's Ark,"Open your eyes

Make room for a little sweet love
The Lord is all around you, child
And that's what you're made of
Remember: there is a light

And it shines bright just for you
And you can't cut yourself off from it
No matter what you do

I had a 3. 5 at Duke
And I was blowin up
Three albums, I got a row of ducks
When my dad was 22
Dog he drove a truck
January in Detroit is cold as fuck
You know its tough
But I came this far I ain't slowin up
Livin life with the lebron james shoulder shrug
One thing you'll never hear me say is ""close enough""
I'm dope as fuck

I lost 2018 to a broken heart
I wrote this whole thing, I know my part
I made a wild fire from a glowing spark
I press go in March, I gotta go and march
All previous conceptions are blown apart
Not everyone can come with me it's Noah's Ark
I Ain't Gregg Popovich, I have no remark
These are the type riches one can only hold in heart

And anyone that's gone over my history
Knows I ain't stuck in the mold of the industry
I am walking down a road of epiphanies
Three words: Growth Over Consistency
Back again, they've been tapping out, McGregor
I've been tapping in
Livin out the dreams I was once just imagining
It's happening, I get so much work done nowadays
It's almost like I have a twin

I can't just sit on the couch
Shoveling shit in my mouth
I don't know how I'm gonna walk across this country
But I know I'm a figure it out

And who knows what I'm gonna do when it's done
Hopefully, I touch a life: you can be one
I'm not walking to show people who l am
I'm walking to find out who I'll become

The people ain't stupid, they know what's real
Sometime to get to heaven, we gotta go through hell
And I'm rollin' deep, no Adele
You can ask World Wide Wes, dawg, he knows me well
My life's like an instruction manual
How to not be borin' (Not be borin')
It's my spirit, my smile
That have got me soarin'
It broke my heart to tell the band
We would not be tourin'
But I just gotta do this (I gotta do it)
I can't stop explorin'
I was a short lil' Jewish kid, I ain't speak much
My whole life now somethin' that I've dreamed up
With no handout, I look at my heros and
That's what I am now

Yoga class headband now
People say I'm off-brand, how
I am a brand, therefore
Anything I do is on-brand now, I'm on-brand now
People got attached to a version of me
And it hurts when they see a person who's free
But I'm so grateful for all of these lessons
Twice as much money, half the possessions
No drugs, now the vision's clear
People mad 'cause the old me isn't here
All my gold jewelry just disappeared
That's the universe tellin' me to start switchin' gears
The deeper the human, the deeper the songs
Look at my life, the dream isn't gone
I saw all of this two years ago
It's almost like it was me readin' my poem

People copy but they copy wrong
Puttin' out a bunch of sloppy songs
If I die and the Rockies don't
Forget to bury me with Petoskey stone
And opportunities keep on poppin' up
Killer concepts come to me in shavasana
This is just an intro, a daydream
The rest comes January 18th

Open your eyes
Make room for a little sweet love
The Lord is all around you, child
And that's what you're made of
Remember
There is a light
And it shines bright just for you
You can't cut yourself off from it
No matter what you do, no

Open your eyes",Mike Posner,Pop
Not That Simple,"When we first met
I was just a sophomore
We spent the night on lydia's couch
I didn't know you were gonna break my heart then
I didn't know the pain I'd feel right now
And I smiled, yes I smiled
But underneath are memories
That I'm trying, yeah I'm trying
To let go

But it's not that simple
Type of misery
All these mixed up signals
In my head
I still hear these echoes
Of when you loved me
But now you're just someone in my mind
That used to be mine

People used to say I didn't deserve you
I was cool with that, cause I felt the same
But then they played my song on the radio
And I don't think you liked who I became
And so you left, yeah you left
On someone else's arm now
And I'm trying, yeah I'm trying
To let go

But it's not that simple
Type of misery
All these mixed up signals
In my head
I still hear these echoes
Of when you loved me
But now you're just someone in my mind
That used to be mine

Cause baby your beauty marks
Are like shooting stars
And my goofy heart is one of cupids darts
I'm just a nervous guy
And these words of mine
Will reverse the time
To when you were mine
Cuz it's not that simple
Type of misery
All these mixed up signals

But it's not that simple

Nothing Is Wrong,"Yeah, uh

I can worry, I can overthink things
That's exactly when I tend to wanna drink things
Tend to wanna smoke things
'Til I realized there's no thing outside of me
That kinda helped me grow wings
Listen up, I think this is dope
To love's very different than to own
Let that sink in

I grew my hair, but never lost my J Dilla vibe
Airplane mode, don't kill the vibe
I had to remind people I was still alive
I had to remind people of what's real inside
Yeah, yeah, I'm the ""I Took a Pill in"" guy
But even more beautiful with no pill inside
Feel the vibe?

I wanted to be Deion, I was more Wojciechowski
My friends gon' hit the club, I tell 'em go without me
There's a lot that these people don't know about me
I always been that dude though, no Lebowski (Stupid)
Old friends never tell me that I seem different
Ashamed of the way that I used to treat women
Objectifying
Embarrassed, but I'll never lie
Mac is dead; many more are dead inside
Hideous thoughts in this head of mine
I'll choose different ones
Life hit me in the face, but I didn't run
Perhaps Michigan'll be the place my kids are from
Ram Dass is the man I got the vision from

It's alright, yeah, uh
It's alright, yeah
Uh, ayy

I donated all my Jordans, didn't do a post
They were taking up the space that I needed to grow
That was a Sage Francis line; I stole it
But there was no better way to say that
There is no future, no time
Look at yourself; don't be so bovine
Courage used to be something that I couldn't find
People scared to look at their dreams
so they look at mine, yeah
Whatever makes you feel good inside (It's alright)

I was in the gym the other day in Los Angeles
And I saw all of the beautiful bodies
Running on the treadmills, staring at the screens
And it reminded me of hamsters running on the wheel
And that's when I really decided right then and there
I'm not gon' be a hamster on a wheel
I'm gon' do it
Twitter is apoplectic
Squirrels with acorns
I said it before
Ships are safe in the harbor
but that ain't what ships are made for
I say I am not my haircut, I'm not my body
Not my clothes; I'm something much more beautiful
Deeper than even I know
Took me 30 years to wake up and write this song
Took me 30 years to realize nothing is wrong",Mike Posner,Pop
Once In a While (Mike Meets Jessie J),"At 2 o' clock in Hollywood, which means I gotta leave here by 1
I should call an Uber at 12: 50
And then after that I gotta meet Bear at Joe's Falafel for dinner at 8 PM (Correct)
Shit, I need a day off
(Once in a while, once in a while, once in a while
Once in a while, once in a while, once in a while)
I think that'd be good for me, honestly
If I just chill that'd be

(Once in a while, once in a while, once in a while)
Gonna get ready now though, huh
(Once in a while, once in a while, once in a whilе)
Yo, this haircut is crazy, my God

Bald head smooth, not too shabby
Tom Ford cologne so Jessiе know I'm classy
I keep the bottle next to the heat on the dresser
That was too much she'll think I'm trying to impress her
I take another shower to wash off the smell
20 minutes late now, need excuse to tell
I'll just blame it on the traffic, better yet an accident
Car went in a backspin, it was tragic
On the 405 that's it
I call an Uber X
Here comes a man named Dafar in a Camry
Hurry up, I need the Grammy before I'm an antique
I'm too antsy, I get to the studio
There's a white dude in a hoodie named Andy

(Hey, my name's Andy, I'll be your engineer)
Cool
(Jessie's not here)
Alright
(can I offer you a drink)
Yeah, I'll take a cold beer
(We only have water and juice)
That's so L. A. Makes sense

I kill the time lookin' at my DMs, I check 'em

(Once in a while, once in a while, once in a while)
(She's not bad)
Yeah, I check 'em every
(Once in a while, once in a while, once in a while)

And Jessie walks in the room like ahh
Bodyguard with her like (don't get too close, motherfucker)
And I gotta say that she smelled like ahh
I'm dumbfound lookin like ""mm, good God! ""
And suddenly I'm so not prepared
I'm doing my best just not to stare
I'm wonderin' how I got in here
Must be the Lord's blessings
The first thing she says is

Christ, Mike dear
What've you done with all your hair
You're lookin' like a white monk, it's weird

Well you know I just shaved it all off
It's just something that I do every

Once in a while, once in a while, once in a while
Once in a while, once in a while, once in a while
Once in a while, once in a while, once in a while
Once in a while, once in a while, once in a while, yeah

Now I'm super embarrased, in all fairness
She wasn't tryna be mean, she was just surprised
Or maybe she was and now I'm just justifyin' the behavior
Because I love her but I'd touch her as much as I love her eyes
That must be why I tell her ""you look very pretty today""
Nice one, dummy (uh, thanks)
Very original
I am sensing something subliminal (this guy's weird)
I think she doesn't really like me (I don't like him)
I think she's thinkin' that I'm lame as fuck (he's lame as fuck)
Yeah, she's thinkin' that I'm lame as fuck (yup)
So imma sing her a song that I already wrote
And pretend I just made it up

Hey, uh, hey Jessie
Yeah
What if we tried something like

Don't do me dirty, show me some mercy
Darlin', please lay down your weaponry (that's cool)
How did I end up somewhere between, oh (uhh)
Lover and a memory
'Cause I don't believe in a halfway heart (that's cool)
Ba-buh-duh-duh-duh-duh-duh-duh-duh-duh (y'know?)
Mm-a-bee-dah-dah (Something like that)
That's dope
It'll sound
I like it
It'll sound better in your voice, too, when you sing it",Mike Posner,Pop
One Foot Out The Door,"(Get familiar)
One foot out the door [x2]
Oh Lord
I've got one foot out the door
Everybody seems so sure
I'm gonna lose my way
Because they were the ones to put the keys in the lock
Then I can't stop no more
I can't feel my face
I'ma keep walking forward
'Till the day I turn around
And walk back in the scene
As I did when we came before

One Hell of a Song,"This is what the Lord wants me to do
In my heart, I just believe that there's no proof
I think about the chorus, the melody's important
But nothing sounds sweeter than the truth
I used to sip the whiskey and hit the bong
I gave that up, now all my friends are gone
And my folks don't understand I ain't no macho man
But I know how to write one hell of a song

Yeah, I'm a shy young man with a real big heart
I still haven't found where I belong
But you know my sweet Lord gave me just one thing
Darling, I know how to write one hell of a song
Yeah, I know how to write one hell of a song

Wrote one for Snoop, did not take long
Wrote one for Bieber and one for Sean
And Jay Z offered me a deal
I said ""Dawg, throw in another mil""
Cause you know I can write one hell of a song

Yeah, I'm a shy young man with a real big heart
I still haven't found where I belong
But you know my sweet Lord gave me just one thing
Darling, I know how to write one hell of a song
Yeah, I know how to write one hell of a song

James

Sometimes I stay up well past dawn
If God puts one in my head, that's what he wants
I'm a simple type of artist, I don't like to walk red carpets
I would rather write one hell of a song
Yeah, I wrote this and it's one hell of a song

Only God Knows,"Only God knows
Only God knows
Only God knows how hard I've been trying
Only God knows
Only God knows
Only God knows the trouble on my mind

""There's more to life than living"", a wise man told me this
Or maybe it was me who wrote it, I can't remember which
In any case what I mean, life's an unfinished poem
Don't go mad trying to figure out the ending
The day that Norman died, I found out through an email
The irony of that, I will not discuss in detail
My future is on thin ice and my past is all online
But only God knows the trouble on my mind

Only God knows
Only God knows
Only God knows how hard I've been trying
Only God knows
Only God knows
Only God knows the trouble on my mind

My walls are filled with artwork, my art is filled with paint
My head is filled with big old thoughts
of all the things I ain't
I bet you know what that's like
though you never drop your guard
Only God knows the places that you're scarred
I'm sitting on a park bench in the city I don't know
Trying to convince myself that I'm not all alone
But my immediate surroundings suggest otherwise
Only God knows the trouble on my mind

Only God knows
Only God knows
Only God knows how hard I've been trying
Only God knows
Only God knows
Only God knows the trouble on my mind (mind)
Only God knows the trouble on my mind (on my mind)

People want to know (You, if you, if you, if you, if, if you, if)

If you ever get tired being perfect
Do you ever get tired being perfect?

I got on a flight, the plane's brand new
We can make it to New York in an hour or two
Look down on the city from heights high as these
Everything's perfect
And my friend tells me that I'm too nice
Her voice trails off, I know she wants advice
I recycle some quote I heard Dillon write
It's that everything's perfect


(Perfect, perfect, perfect, perfect)
(Perfect, perfect, perfect, perfect)

When I wake up before you and just watch you sleep
that's
(Perfect, perfect, perfect, perfect)
And you tell me later you were dreaming of me
(Perfect, perfect, perfect, perfect)
When I walk down the street and the trees know my name
(Perfect, perfect, perfect, perfect)
People I don't know around an open flame, that's
(Perfect, perfect, perfect, perfect)
A grandmother's fingers around a granddaughter's hand
(Perfect, perfect, perfect, perfect)
People speaking languages that I don't understand
(Perfect, perfect, perfect, perfect)
When you stare into my eyes and I'm thinking you're the one that's
(Perfect, perfect, perfect, perfect)
When my mama tells me that she's proud of what I've done
(Perfect, perfect, perfect, perfect)
When the winter ends in the city that I'm from (That's)
(Perfect, perfect, perfect, perfect)
When I open up and get hurt by someone (That's)
(Perfect, perfect, perfect, perfect)
When you trust somebody and they don't let you down (That's)
(Perfect, perfect, perfect, perfect)
When somebody you love dies, but you still feel 'em around

Oh, yeah
Oh, yeah
Do you ever get tired (Oh, yeah)
Of being perfect?

Do you ever get tired (Oh, yeah)
Of being perfect?",Mike Posner,Pop

And I got signed in July
You must think that I don't remember
Cause now you call me all the time
If you think I'm gon take you back

You should leave me alone
Stop calling my phone
Cause I'm just gonna hit that, hit that, hit that

You should leave me alone, leave me alone

Rocket Man (Feat. Bun B),"[Mike Posner:]
She packed my bags last night pre-flight
Zero hour nine AM.
And I'm gonna be high as a kite by then
I miss the earth so much I miss my wife
It's lonely out in space
On such a timeless flight

I think it's gonna be a long long time
Till touch down brings me round again to find
I'm not the man they think I am at home
Oh no no no I'm a rocket man
And all this science I don't understand
It's just my job five days a week
You don't wanna be high
High like me

[Chorus:]
I think it's gonna be a long long time
Till touch down brings me round again to find
I'm not the man they think I am at home
Oh no no no I'm a rocket man

Eh, eh I'm a rocket man
Yeah I'm a rocket man
I'm a rocket man

[Bun B:]
Huston we got some problems
I don't know how your boy gonna solve them
The command center just won't leak
And it counts us down
I don't know what to think
Happening in a blink
Sorta like the big Bang
How did something so small
Urn in to a big thing
One small move turn in to a big chain
Don't waste no trouble
I'll make range
And it seems so strange, but it all makes sense
My back against the wall
End-up behind the fence
Situations always get so tense
And I just want us to still be friends
But we just argue, fuss and fight
And we scream and yell and we curse all night
And it seems that we're always so uptight
Think that it's time that I book this flight
To calm my mind
But I feel so weak
So much to say but I just can't speak
Gotta be dumb, but I can; t even do it
Came as a surprise, but we always knew it
So I'm taking this trip, no plane no car
Might be close and it might be far
But lady soon, when you look up at the moon
I'll be next to it shining like a star

[Chorus:]
I think it's gonna be a long long time
Till touch down brings me round again to find
I'm not the man they think I am at home
Oh no no no I'm a rocket man",Mike Posner,Pop
Rolling In The Deep,"There's a fire starting in my heart,
Reaching a fever pitch and it's bring me out the dark,

Finally, I can see you crystal clear,
Go ahead and sell me out and I'll lay your sheet bare,
See how I'll leave with every piece of you,
Don't underestimate the things that I will do,

There's a fire starting in my heart,
Reaching a fever pitch and it's bring me out the dark,

The scars of your love remind me of us,
They keep me thinking that we almost had it all,
The scars of your love, they leave me breathless,
I can't help feeling,

We could have had it all,
(You're gonna wish you never had met me),
Rolling in the deep,
(Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep),
You had my heart inside of your hands,
(You're gonna wish you never had met me),
And you played it to the beat,
(Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep),

Baby, I have no story to be told,
But I've heard one on you and I'm gonna make your head burn,
Think of me in the depths of your despair,
Make a home down there as mine sure won't be shared,

The scars of your love remind me of us,
(You're gonna wish you never had met me),
They keep me thinking that we almost had it all,

And you played it to the beat,
(Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep),

Could have had it all,
Rolling in the deep,
You had my heart inside of your hands,
But you played it with a beating,

Throw your soul through every open door,
Count your blessings to find what you look for,
Turn my sorrow into treasured gold,
You'll pay me back in kind and reap just what you've sown,

(You're gonna wish you never had met me),
We could have had it all,
(Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep),
We could have had it all,
(You're gonna wish you never had met me),
It all, it all, it all,
(Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep),

We could have had it all,
(You're gonna wish you never had met me),
Rolling in the deep,
(Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep),
You had my heart inside of your hands,
(You're gonna wish you never had met me),
And you played it to the beat,
(Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep),

Could have had it all,
(You're gonna wish you never had met me),
Rolling in the deep,

Then I coco butter you
Then we do what lovers do

Shave It All Off,"Our story begins in a Los Angeles mansion
That aging artist Mike Posner is renting for the week. He's in L. A. to write songs for other, more famous artists
We join him as his barber Tracy arrives at the mansion to give him a haircut

""What up doe Tracy? ""
""Hey Mike! Welcome back to L. A. ! How you doing? ""

I guess I'm famous again
Shave off the beard
I think when we do it it's gon' take off a year
Privacy for press
The trade off is weird
But really its my last chance to stave off the fear
Of being famous again
Got me back in L. A
I sold my house here but I can't get away
I got a session today with the singer Jessie J
I'm renting this mansion where I'll stay
Turn your head this way
So how you want it cut?
Well, I think that the green is played
And to be honest, I've been feeling kinda off these days
It's something happening inside me, I can feel the change
These people want a fucking show? Okay
Shave it all off!
Hey, Mike are- are you okay? Are you sure?

Didn't take that long to figure out it wasn't working
She was sad, I was touring
Wasn't worth it
Thats tough. How'd you word it?
Well i texted her tha
You texted her?
I know I'm a bad person
But it all felt cursed when she would sit around and drink and shit
You can't be rescued by a sinking ship
Thats true
So I pushed what i loved away (but why?)
Some people can't take L. A. (that's a cop-out)
I guess that I was one of 'em (that's bullshit)
It's not bullshit I'm one of them (I think you messed up)

But who are you to tell me that I'm wrong
She never really liked me anyway
Just shave it all off
She's just another girl now with a song
And i'm just another sad man in L. A
Okay

Hey, Tracy just leave it alone
Okay, wheres your session at?
Paramount on Santa Monica at 2
Meetin' blackbear for dinner in the valley when it's through
Well your hair's done, look in the mirror
Nah i don't need to. People who stare into mirrors are all see through
Well, let me wipe the hair from ur face, it's all messy

I am not your last dude
Where'd you get this attitude?

Talkin' 'bout you're leavin'

For so damn long

Slow it Down,"Alright
Right now

I'm in prison and I think I built my own cell
Prophets speak softly, homie, they don't yell
Only those that hear my music know my lower depths
The doer does, the knower rests
The scholar learns, the sage forgets
If I could wrap my head around it
Then I might get a shot
I get what I think about whether I like it or not
When things go wrong, life doesn't stop
I need to quit pollutin' my mind with sex and violence
The secret that I'm seekin' was left in silence
And my microphone is pointin' God's finger
I'm a saint disguised as a pop singer
Here's a fun fact
Most people leave their potential untapped
There will be more than camping gear to unpack
Sometimes, you gotta go there just to come back

Slow it down, I still got the feelin', baby
Slow it down, no more runnin' around
I say slow it down, I still got the feelin', baby
Slow it down, no more runnin' around

My foot hurts, I didn't get sleep
My dad died, my horoscope ain't in sync
I'm misunderstood and Twitter is ruthless
Uh oh, I think my problems are excuses
For not bein' who I know I am
I'm 31, there's no one left to hold my hand
Though I believe I got someone watchin' over me
I believe I'm exactly where I'm supposed to be
I believe that even when the road is bleak
That these obstacles were set up just for me
And family matters, I'm on some Urkel shit
Posner on a Primo beat, this some full circle shit
I believe no matter how high the hurdles get
I can flip this whole thing into an internal win
Life ain't meant to be a heavy thing
Met Ram Dass, he told me, ""Just love everything""
Fall in Michigan, there's wisdom in my loose leaf
For the first time, I feel like the true me

Slow it down, I still got the feelin', baby
Slow it down, no more runnin' around
I say slow it down, I still got the feelin', baby
Slow it down, no more runnin' around

Some days, I can't get out of bed
Crippled by negative thoughts inside my head
Like why do I always stop before my limits?
And why am I only good at lovin' people from a distance?
Why and I so vain? Obsessed with fitness?
Why are the only people I'm around my assistants?
But wait, the last time I felt this way
I bucked up, kept goin' and got my shit straight
Diddy told me go with my heart
So my focus is art, not where I go on the chart
The divine light in me loves to glow in the dark
If my life was a movie, we'd be approachin' the part
Where the hero wins and learns don't
Chase what you already got and returns home
Those who say don't know, those who know don't say
I'm done walking with the herd, it's time I go my own way

Slow it down, I still got the feelin', baby
Slow it down, no more runnin' around
I say slow it down, yeah, I still got the feelin', baby

Smoke And Drive,"[Chorus:]
Roll the windows up when you get in the car, and I'ma light one up
Hit the gas station go and buy a cigar and a philly blunt
Every time I breathe it's like I'm taking a puff, turn my music high
Roll the windows up, when I smoke and drive

[Verse 1:]
All black car (car)
Three percent tint
I can clearly see out
But you can barely see in
The end and only end
We blowing Indonesia
And I'ma let it hit til I get amnesia
I'm crazy the haze got me hazy I'm lazy
Tell Ben that it something about Mary and clearly (what)
I'm so outta here you can say a nigga spacey (damn)
Pocket full of papers so I'm finnin to get some papers (yeah)
Bout to inhale like I'm finnin to see Satan (what)
Bout to exhale like I'm finnin to see my savior
So get the leaves and trees like it's autumn
Have them windows all rolled up rolled em and told em man

[Chorus:]
Roll the windows up when you get in the car, and I'ma light one up
Hit the gas station go and buy a cigar and a philly blunt
Every time I breathe it's like I'm taking a puff, turn the music high
Roll the windows up, when I smoke and drive

[Verse 2:]
First of all til you ball like this
You don't put this type of pimp in your swish
Get it we smoking on that poison call it Michael Bivins
So if you selling to me then you gotta lucrative business
A friend is what you blow while I'm smoking on that CEO
Top notch I got foot by the foot in my fruit roll up
No cuts no stems no seeds straight THC indeed
I'm tryna get stoned like I'm staring into Medusa eyes
You ain't got green what somebody tell me who supply
So I can buy wholesale for the low like Cosco or Sams
You got some well damn

[Chorus:]
Roll the windows up when you get in the car, and I'ma light one up
Hit the gas station go and buy a cigar and a philly blunt
Every time I breathe it's like I'm taking a puff, turn the music high
Roll the windows up, when I smoke and drive

[Verse 3:]
I don't smoke phillies pass me and swisher
Bumping PMC pouring out a little liquor
Trunk full of kicker blunt full of OG
Right behind tint cuz these jack boys know me
Smokin' sour diesel out of NYC
Keisha calling ATL oh well I'm kushin DC
Which ones better roll up I need a time
Take a ride downtown man I'm higher than these skyscapers
Roll the windows up tryna get my smoke on
2 in the morning still riding with my Locs on
Fuck the police what these pigs gon' tell me
Smoking bud at nights like X off a Bentley

[Chorus:]
Roll the windows up when you get in the car, and I'ma light one up
Hit the gas station go and buy a cigar and a philly blunt
Every time I breathe it's like I'm taking a puff, turn the music high

Song About You,"Put all your stuff in a box in my room
I don't wanna write no song about you
But you show up in everything that I do
Ooh, ooh-ooh

Since you've been gone, ain't got nothin' to do
I sleep until noon, I wake up and feel bad
I think I miss somethin' I never had
Ooh, ooh-ooh

I just wanna unwind, unwind
Everything that makes me feel confined
Sometimes I hate sunshine
Sometimes I hate sunshine

Put all your stuff in a box in my room
I don't wanna write no song about you
But you show up in everything that I do
Ooh, ooh-ooh

Now it's a cold war, who will call first?
Try to be productive at work, I just can't
I miss you a lot, but I ain't comin' back
Ooh, ooh-ooh

I just wanna unwind, unwind
Everything that makes me feel confined
Sometimes I hate sunshine
Sometimes I hate sunshine

Put all your stuff in a box in my room
I don't wanna write no song about you
But you show up in everything that I do
Ooh, ooh-ooh

Yeah, yeah
All your love letters and a pair of Ray-Bans
I'm growin' my beard, movin' back in my van
Your side of the bed still smells like you though
And these memories of us, it's brutal
You know, you know exactly how I feel
We broke up, but you be on my mind still
And the worst type of sadness you could have
Is when you miss somethin' that doesn't miss you back

Put all your stuff in a box in my room
I don't wanna write no song about you
But you show up in everything that I do

All the things on my mind
Like, I remember this time last year
I was all alone
I felt like I was two feet tall
Now there's a hundred million numbers
Inside of my phone
But I still got no one to call
My life's like

How much they believe in me
I wish that I saw the things that they see in me

Ay, do it, ay, music, ay
High rise, elevator life
I'm gone in 60 seconds
Or Talladega nights
I know I'm living wrong
I wish I could make it right
But baby, hold that thought...
Cause I gotta take this flight
When I leave my passport
Overseas passports
Hotels with the glass floors
Everything I ask for
Fast cars, fast hoes
My whole life is fast foward
But if I stop, stop
I might hit that dashboard
And I be, I be
I be, I be always take and choose
In and out relations with
Girls who want relationships
And I can fake a smile
And I end a conversation well
We just can't see eye to eye
We might need that LASIK shit
Cause tomorrow I'll be gone gone gone
Dip into another time zone zone zone
Tryna make my hotel feel like home home home
Phone won't stop ringing but I still feel all alone
My life's like

Staring at the Fire,"I've always had trouble staying still
I stand next to what I hate just for the thrill
Spent the first quarter of my life on a million dollar bill
'Cause I can't stop staring at the fire
We got our crosses and our buildings, built 'em tall
And my book's another brick inside the wall
We sure make ourselves feel busy, but we don't do much at all
Except sit around and stare at the fire
And the protesters have gathered in the streets
Opposite, a block full of police
But they both have the same problem with God as you and me
It's that they can't stop staring at the fire

Watch it burn, burn, burn
Watch it burn, burn, burn
Watch it burn, burn, burn
Watch it burn, burn, burn

Went to an ashram a million miles from here
An old man on a blanket appeared
He waved me to come closer, and he whispered in my ear
""Son, you've got to stop staring at the fire""
But all my ego trips come in flocks
And they tell me, ""Kid, it's really not that hot""
Take your anxiety and your guilt, just throw it all on top
Now I can't stop standing in the fire

Oh, watch me burn, burn, burn
Watch me burn, burn, burn
Watch me burn, burn, burn
Watch me burn, burn, burn
Oh, watch me burn, burn, burn
Watch me burn, burn, burn
Watch me burn, burn, burn
Watch me burn, burn, burn",Mike Posner,Pop

I'm gonna stay with you

And I just so happened to break up with my latest girl
So I think you should come over and be my latest girl

And even though I fuck other girls
Now I don’t want them, so
We can pretend that were right back in 2000 yo, 2000 yo

Everybody knows I’m still not over you
Not over you
And every time I lose a girlfriend
I call you
Ya I call you

Walk with me
I made a few more beats since the last time you done talk to me
I got a few more connects in the game
But that’s not all I need
Remember back in the day
You had a massive phone bill
From calling me
Why you stop calling me?

Remember babe
I wrote you all those love notes in 7th grade
I hope you threw those out when we went out separate ways
Cause I don’t want to see them up for sale on ebay
Don’t put them on ebay

Everybody knows im still not over you
Not over you
And every time I lose a girlfriend
I call you

Tracy Calls Noelle (Mike's Ex),"I don't mean to cause no trouble
I don't mean to steal your joy
I don't mean to burst your bubble
But he's just a little boy

Hey Noelle, how you doin'?
(?) , how are you?
I'm good, I just cut Mike, he said you guys are through? (Yeah)
Oh my god, I didn't know, sweetie, are you ok?
T, I've never been better, what'd that motherfucker say?
Well I'm not sure I should get in the middle of it
Did he tell you that he dumped me? (Yeah) Aww, little pig
The sex was terrible, never talked to me
Studio all day, he never stopped to eat
He's a weirdo
So I told him we should go see
Other people
Now he runs around LA sayin'
That I'm evil
You seein' anybody new?
Yeah, blackbear, and he's got that (?) too
Isn't that Mike's best friend?
MM-hmm, but Mike don't know
When he (?)
I don't like the sounds of this, Noelle!
I ain't ask for assistance, besides T
It's really none of your business (Yeah, right)

I don't mean to cause no trouble (I don't mean to cause no trouble, I just...)
I don't mean to steal your joy (I love both of you guys)
I don't mean to burst your bubble

I don't mean to cause no trouble
I don't mean to steal your joy
I don't mean to burst your bubble
But he's just a little boy

It's just I'm kinda worried about him
It seems like he's got a dark cloud around him
I don't think he took the breakup well at all
Today he asked me to shave his whole head bald
Did you do it? - I had to
Oh my god! I bet he looks so dumb
I mean you're right
But I don't think he has anyone
He's working with Jessy, but he ain't having fun
And next to his cologne on a dresser I swear I saw a gun
Who cares? He just wants attention
He's even havin' a party tonight at the house that he's rentin'
I'mma go and make sure he sees me in my new man's arms
That's gonna kill him! - Too bad for him

I don't mean to cause no trouble (Your really shouldn't go to this party, Noelle)
I don't mean to steal your joy (This is gonna be bad)
I don't mean to burst your bubble
But he's just a little boy (I have a bad feeling about this)
I don't mean to cause no trouble (He's just a little boy and he's- he doesn't- he can't control himself)

Traveling Man (Snippet),"I'm a traveling man
Made a lot of stops, all over the world
But in every part, I own the heart
Of at least one lovely girl

I have a pretty senorita
Waiting for me
When I get back to LA
And all the girls that I ran through
When I was in cancun
I still don't know their names

Oh my georgia beach down in ATL
Calls me everyday
And my brooklyn girl back in NYC meets me at JFK

Pretty pouerto rican baby I met at the bar
I remember the time
I left the studio late
But you fixed me a plate
And then you let me spend the night

Ohh I'm a traveling man

Wake Up,"I'm going to ride this plane out of your life again.
I wish that I could stay. ""but,"" you argue.
More than this, I wish you could've seen my face
In backseats staring out of the window.

I'll do anything for you,
Kill anyone for you.

So leave yourself intact
'cause I will be coming back.
In a phrase to cut these lips,
I love you.

The morning will come
In the press of every kiss
With your head upon my chest
Where I will annoy you
With every waking breath
Until you decide to wake up.

I've earned through hope and faith
On the curves around your face
That I'm the one you'll hold forever.
If morning never comes for either one of us,
Then this I pray to you wherever.

I'll do anything for you.
This story is for you.
('cause I'd do anything you want me to for you.)
I'll do anything for you,
Kill anyone for you.

So leave yourself intact

With your head upon my chest
Where I will annoy you

Weaponry (With Jessie J),"Must you do this
Treat me ruthless

Don't do me dirty
Show me some mercy
Darlin', please lay down your weaponry
How did I end up somewhere between a lover and a memory?
Cause I don't believe in a halfway heart
And you gave me all of my favorite scars
How did I end up somewhere between a lover and memory?

I been drinking I been smoking
I been waiting I been hoping that there's still some chance
