<BOS> But I'm thinkin' to myself that "Weaponry" is wack and corny Halfway through it starts to bore me Kind of a knock-off of Leonard Cohen's style Noelle on my mind, we ain't spoken in a while Jessie J offers me a J I ain't smoked one in a while I say okay, I took it and smile But now I'm just sad and high I thank her for the session and we say goodbye I pack up my laptop and my hard drives My microphone compressor and my guitar I'm Meetin' bear at Joe's Falafel [?] there's no falafel Too many agents, too many managers People sayin' words just to fill up all the calendars That's why I moved from L. A To get away from all thе bad ideas people tеll me Like  You should take it easy Baby, you should take it easy  So I'm in an Uber Black 'cause I wanna impress Mr. blackbear I know will be very well-dressed And if we take a photo then I wanna look dope, uh I need all the hoes DMing Mike Posner My ego's hard to tame My fame remains the best card to play Text from blackbear, "where are you? " Well, I'm not that far away But the 101's slammed, so it's hard to say How long before I pull up so I pull up The poem on my iPhone I was workin' on earlier today And try to make some headway  To whom it may concern (that's a good opening) Right before the sky gets too tired to hold up the stars (that's a nice line) Right before virtual reality becomes realer than real reality (that's really shitty writing) Right before we smoke ourselves out and the oceans turn black  And by the time I finish it up, I've arrived Noelle's on my mind, maybe I should try To call her up, let down my defense Nah, I need to just listen to my friends When they tell me  You should take it easy Baby, you should take it easy  So I walk in 20 minutes late Bear's waitin' with a little funny look upon his face And he says "you look like a cancer patient" I remember I'm bald, now he's testin' my patience He reads my face and sees I don't think it's funny "What's up with you, man, sad with all that money? You ride around in open limousines lookin' like Jimmy Dean Feelin' clean, Rag and Bone, you got the winnin' genes" I hear what he's sayin' but it's not effective I can't see things from his perspective "You know, I know what you need Look at me, don't text Some brand new pussy will get your mind off your ex" Thank you, Dr. blackbear for breakin' me down But my L. A. girls all hate me now 'Cause I moved to Detroit I don't reply to texts So I doubt that they're gonna retry the sex "Doesn't matter, here's what we're gonna do You gotta big mansion that you're stayin' in, true? " (True) "You throw a big party, I'll invite models And you know Diddy, free Ciroc bottles! " But I hate L. A. parties "It'll feel like Cabo You need this, dog, you're lookin' high-low" He's right, I need it, he's not lyin' But what about the house, man? It's not mine  You should take it easy ("This gonna be fun. In fact, it's gonna be better than fun") Baby, you should take it easy ("This is gonna be amazing. You hear me? Amazing. ")  But the cleaner fee, who's gonna pay that shit? "Did you really just say that? Dude, you're rich! Live a little, I'm not sayin' buy Ferarris All I'm sayin' is let's have a party" <EOS>

<BOS> I look out on the city lights The guarded streets below I marvel at my history The things that I don't know Just another question A shadow on my soul Will there be time Will there be time before I go  I left home in a hurry Off to see the world Then I played some music Then I loved a girl Someone called me papa Took my breath away Would I be fine Would I be alright with just today Will there be time enough for me before I go  Love without rules Love without end Sending a lofty prayer for peace out on the wind Breaking the curse Breaking the chain..... Making a promise I won't have to make again  I look out on the city lights The stories that they tell And wonder at my destiny Beyond this carousel Such a hollow question A tether frayed by fear Will there be time Time to let go while I'm here Will there be time enough for me so I'll know Will there be time enough for me before I go   Copyright 1995 Christopher Cross Songs/Moonblind Music <EOS>

<BOS> As the sun rises it soon compromises the safety of night And two travelers in spite of themselves Have to push on  Mornings remind them of things left behind them One a good wife and the other a life with no name So they push on  Over the hills and the plains they ride Sharing the unwritten law they abide Two uncharted hearts in the silence of their own flight  The journey they measure in danger and pleasure One likes to bluff and the other is tough on the girls Still they push on  Roll the bones Devil-may-care No questions asked Barely friends Two solitaires Needing each other out there  They build a good fire before they retire Searching the flame for a moment of blameless repose A way to push on Lessons come hard on this brave terrain They may run free but they're still in the rain Two uncharted hearts in the silence of their own flight <EOS>

<BOS> There was a little boy once upon a time Who in spite of his young age and small size knew his mind For every copper penny and clover he would find Make a wish for better days the end of hard times For no more cold feet Cold cold cold cold feet His clothes were always clean His face was always scrubbed There was food on the table enough to fill him up His house was full of life His house was full of love But when winter days arrived There was never money enough to shod his cold feet Cold cold cold cold feet  He grew up to be a worker determined to succeed He made a life for himself, free from worldly wants or needs But with nobody to share the life he'd made No body to keep him warm at night When he'd go to sleep he'd sleep alone with his cold feet Cold cold cold cold feet  One night he walked the street looking to the heaven's above Searching for a shooting star a benevolent God When a woman passing by brushed his arm He turned and found love He then wished for the courage to ask this stranger Who she was to not have cold feet Cold cold cold cold feet  He thought she'd like the party life and want the finer things So he promised more than he could buy And he promised her the sun and moon to not have cold feet Cold cold cold cold feet  He worked day and night his fingers to the bone Hi worried mind guilty conscience drive him on He can't give her what she needs He wants to give her what he thinks she wants Her sad-eyed face, his empty pockets drive him on and his cold feet Cold cold cold cold feet  He'd struggled all his life to be an honest man Proud that the dirt on his palms was the soil of the land But some guys he knew from high school days Said they had a plan to get rich quick And they could count him in if he don't have cold feet Cold cold cold cold feet  He thought about their offer accepted it without qualms Dreamt about the life he'd buy The comfort that would come without cold feet Cold cold cold cold feet  He decided to tell his wife things would soon turn around He said the little boy is dead A man stands with you now without cold feet Cold cold cold cold feet Without cold feet - Cold cold cold cold feet  He thought he'd set his clock right - He though he'd read his watch He left in such a hurry he didn't think to wish for luck Makes no difference if you're early - No difference if you're late When you're out of time - The flowers have been laid You're six feet underground With cold feet Cold cold cold cold feet <EOS>
<BOS> All along it was a fever A cold sweat hot-headed believer I threw my hands in the air I said show me something He said, if you dare come a little closer  Round and around and around and around we go Ohh now tell me now tell me now tell me now you know  Not really sure how to feel about it Something in the way you move Makes me feel like I can't live without you It takes me all the way I want you to stay, stay I want you to stay, ohh  Ohh the reason I hold on Ohh 'cause I need this hole gone Funny you're the broken one But I'm the only one who needed saving 'Cause when you never see the lights It's hard to know which one of us is caving  Not really sure how to feel about it Something in the way you move Makes me feel like I can't live without you It takes me all the way I want you to stay, stay I want you to stay, ohh I want you to stay <EOS>
<BOS> [Chorus] When I'm away from you I'm happier than ever Wish I could explain it better I wish it wasn't true  [Verse 1] Give me a day or two to think of something clever To write myself a letter To tell me what to do, mm-mm Do you read my interviews? Or do you skip my avenue? When you said you were passin' through Was I even on your way? I knew when I asked you to Be cool about what I was tellin' you You'd do the opposite of what you said you'd do And I'd end up more afraid Don't say it isn't fair You clearly weren't aware that you made me miserable So if you really wanna know  [Chorus] When I'm away from you I'm happier than ever Wish I could explain it better I wish it wasn't true [Intermission]  [Verse 2] You call me again, drunk in your Benz Drivin' home under the influence You scared me to death, but I'm wastin' my breath 'Cause you only care about your I don't relate to you No, I don't relate to you, no 'Cause I'd never treat me this -y You make me hate this city  [Verse 3] And I don't talk - about you on the internet Never told anyone anything bad 'Cause that -s embarrassing, and you were my everything All that you did was make me - sad So don't waste the time I don't have And don't try to make me feel bad I could talk about every time that you showed up on time But I'd have an empty line 'cause you never did Never paid any mind to my mother or friends So I shut them all out for you 'cause I was a kid  [Outro] And you ruined everything good Always said you were misunderstood Made all my moments your own Just - leave me alone <EOS>

<BOS> As I walk this land with broken dreams I have visions of many things Love's happiness is just an illusion Filled with sadness and confusion, What becomes of the broken hearted Who had love that's now departed? I know I've got to find Some kind of peace of mind Maybe.  The fruits of love grow all around But for me they come a tumblin' down. Every day heartaches grow a little stronger I can't stand this pain much longer I walk in shadows Searching for light Cold and alone No comfort in sight, Hoping and praying for someone to care Always moving and goin to where What becomes of the broken hearted Who had love that's now departed? I know I've got to find Some kind of peace of mind Maybe.  I'm searching though I don't succeed, But someone look, there's a growing need. Oh, he is lost, there's no place for beginning, All that's left is an unhappy ending. Now what's become of the broken-hearted Who had love that's now departed? I know I've got to find Some kind of peace of mind I'll be searching everywhere Just to find someone to care.  I'll be looking everyday I know I'm gonna find a way Nothings gonna stop me now I'll find a way somehow I'll be searching everywhere (fade) <EOS>
