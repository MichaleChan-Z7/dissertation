<BOS> Twista feat. Ludacris, Wildstyle   [Intro: Twista + (Ludacris)] Yeah, you know it's about to go down right? (Yeeah!) Got to let them know who is this? (Ludacris!) And who else nigga? (Twista, wooo, ahhh!) Uh, uh (check it out)  [Verse 1: Ludacris] Sometimes I think that I got to see a little bit of brighter days Cause I confine myself to a city near you in a solid cage And you could look to the left or the right but I'm trapped on center stage And I could rap to the beat, but I don't know how to change my ways I still hear a fool and I track them, distract them, and whack them Jack a nigga for the day to days and I yak them, attack them, and sack them Get a weapon and I crack his brain cause I'm a hustler, baller, pro And it wouldn't be right for me to be around busters, and crawlers, and hoes But I'm a pimp at night, so talk shit and I'm a lift them up off of they toes With a street sweeper regulating quarters, and ki's, and o's In a two-seater, Ludacris and Twista with bags of dro Smoking, choking, get them open, croaking It's so potent - I'm hoping to keep on floating Soaking wet and you can bet, people I'm high I'm seeing lions, and tigers and bears - oh my! And I can't hide it or keep it hidden, good riddance I'm felling good I'm weapon-concealing, stealing my neighborhood Would, could, and should break a nigga off They'll see you later, go to the doctor, hold my balls and (cough) You caused some vapors and I caught the throne, brain blown, honey I'm home Give me the microphone, and fools is like, "leave me alone!"  [Chorus: Twista] Throw it up if you get high, get blow, get drunk If you want what I'm on, come on and kick it Let's ride, smoke dro, beat the trunk All the bad ass bitches that want to party Just shake it, great players get pumped Me and my thugs, and hustlers in the party Get money fuck hoes, get crunk  [Verse 2: Twista] (Look out!) I put a little bit of hash on some motherfucking purple haze I feel it all over my body, adrenaline with the Bacardi Got me up and then rippng shit in a rage In the netti cofetti with a belly, Gucci Timberland stepping on the petal up in the Cadillac truck Want to get me for the wood Better get the whole motherfucking hood to come and give you some back up We can get into it and if you want to do it I'm leaking the fluids out of the bodies that want to come at this If they all get some blood for fucking with thugs that I bury My adversaries better not want none of Twis' Represent for my city, anybody that different with me Got to get him for thinking it's a game And whether you from my city or not, talk shit I'ma kill him especially if he say my name I've been up on him - I handle my business And I'm a stick him up for the scrilla, from K-Tilla, smoking on a fat piller Murder haters that don't feel a Niggaz claiming they want to bring it, but really don't be killers Balling out so hard the size of my rims grow to a hellafied sight-scene When the dough become no bigger, I'm going to drop that 2003 on 19"  [Chorus: Twista]  [Verse 3: Twista] We balling out of control, I floss on, play on, pimp on A speed deamon, pedal to the metal when I'm in the zone Hang on cause here I'm gone In the motherfucking wind when I'm sippin on Henn' I got paper, you owe something And I done came a long way from letting me hold something, to roll something Find a body, then fill him up with some adrenaline And then kill him and send him to the cemetery With a flow for the whole world like a poet, Check icy cold, your Pop's so hungry, he mends a berry Shit, and when it come to shipping good Who that?, who that?, I got the sack open And the herb got the flow so strong Hot them on crack, the track is for back-to-back smoking Never come up with it unwise, and he nigga you ain't untouchable when I spark the heat Coming at you like sharks to meat the blood is softly, I can tell when a mark is hard as we Come fully loaded cause I'm hard to beat always screaming where a beat and the dro at? You know we love that cut up In the back of the club with purple in the back crying Twis' and Ludacris get fucked up  [Chorus: Twista]  [Outro: Twista + (Wildstyle)] Pass me the.. Let me smoke my.. (Yeeah, this a Wildstyle production Twista and Ludacris collabo, get it, get it get it, uh, yeeah) <EOS>

<BOS> I was just telling that I got this girl before And I was together since 3 years And em, I was not even cheating on her or what And facebook arrived And she wanted me to accept her on facebook And I don't want it because  I was like in front of her And she told me like "accept me on facebook" It was virtual, made no sense So I say "I'm in front of you I don't need to accept you on facebook" She started to be crazy  She thoughts that because I didn't accept her She thought I was cheating She told me like, uh, it's over And I can't believe it It is crazy because I like her I'm in front of you, I'm every day  Here in your house That's like jealousy Pure jealousy for nothing You know Virtual thing <EOS>
<BOS> She reached her hand out with a pamphlet and I politely said "No, Ma'am" I mean no disrespect and I apologize if this fucks up your program You tell me I'm gonna burn for lying But the heat can turn water to wine Well if there's a hell below then we're all gonna' be just fine.  So there I stood six feet in sin, a walking contradiction but am I wrong for posing questions or am I just another lost soul searching? Then she gave me a look so unchristian And told she'd pray for my children I said "If you're so holy you'll probably out-live me but if I bought a Jesus piece do you think he'd forgive me?"  Maybe I would be a fool to think. That somewhere in the sky's a place for me. What good would it be to pray for me? You won't save me, don't pray for me.  Now I've never been religious, I'm just a big fan of logistics. And if it makes sense then I'm all for it. I even pray if the situation calls for it. Somebody asked me if I believe in miracles, I try to answer without sounding satirical. I'm 3 years past my expiration and yet I'm still fresher than a newborn So I guess that's my explanation but it's safe to say I've never seen a unicorn and I never chase rainbows But I hear the devil wears designer clothes So does God have a favourite brand? and for that matter, is he even a man? and will I go to hell for even saying that? only time will tell I'm just relaying facts.  Maybe I would be a fool to think, That somewhere in the sky's a place for me. What good would it be to pray for me? You won't save me, don't pray for me.  {Instrumental}  Maybe I would be a fool to think, That somewhere in the sky's a place for me. What good would it be to pray for me? You won't save me, don't pray for me.  Maybe I would be a fool to think, That somewhere in the sky's a place for me. What good would it be to pray for me? You won't save me, don't pray for me.

a magnet for sin Punk pretend to be your friend til they get close enough to your ends To do you in, that shit puts me on ten And make me wanna put the barrel of this solid fiend Upon under that nigga's chin, plus he talkin big shit about war Like he don't know my Speedknot Mob gon' win But I dare one of you niggas to say my name Cause I put a fuckin bullet into your closest kin Just to get

I stay clubbed with some thugs, why call 'em stug When it comes to her love, it's none above she drawin blood Static under the bra 'cause everytime I take a hit at the bud And give you a hug you gon' pop up a slug Drinkin' remy on the block, gotta bust the glock When the henny hit the chest, bustin' smith-n-wess Fuck the discussion, I'm bustin' 'em all, clutchin' my balls If I see y'all be laid to rest, let me hit the sess Loose revolver used to be a problem solver But the nina made me a baller No strap could take the place of the black nine Leave 'em flat lines, feelin' fury, you was born to

So that you could do so with me So get your verses ready, hop on the track with me Pay a tribute to the late great whitney houston <EOS>

<BOS> The bombs been detonated I'm just waitin' for an explosion, I was just waitin' on 2nd and it was time for me to close in on 3rd With blurred vision and in, precisely placed slurred words we started kissin' Man listen, it was like a scene from a very bad B movie with a very low budget But fuck it, I was drunk and I admit I loved it Every last second, I couldn't kill that thought of us butt ass naked Tele' surfin' with the fan on, chattin' about the session and, slowly gettin' into some closet skeleton confessions That's when, she made a offer that I couldn't refuse And chills went up and down my legs like Samoan tattoos She said she had a pad that wasn't too far away, and said she'd love if I stayed til the following day So it was time to exit stage left, I made my rounds, gave my pounds and hugs, gathered my thoughts and took a deep breath And now we're walkin' to the door but, right before we stepped outside she bought me one more And now I'm feelin' it, I had my had down my pocket but she's stealing it, with our fingers in a locket and as we're walkin' down Exchange Street, with our hearts pitter pattering to the same beat And then she popped the question like "Jack, you evah been in love?" I'm like "pshhh not that I recall" Well there was one situation, but I didn't have the patience, or the balls to say it and everytime I tried I just digitally delayed it And it sounded like something blah blah blah blah, man my speach impetement left my heart vacant without a single resident The first tenant got evicted the second she settled in, I seen her the other day riding my bike and kept peddlin' If it wasn't for meddlin' kids would love even exist nope, if it wasn't for alcohal would I even be saying this nope She probably took offence, I probably started gettin' sober 'cause she started gettin' ugly and I think probably told her Then my feet got heavy, I started drippin' sweat, knew I was gettin' into something I'd probably regret Right when I lit the cigerrette I caught a case of the spins, and started wishin' I was still at the bar with my friends And then it happened, I fell flat on my face When I awoke I found I was in a very strange place I must've got my wish granted 'cause I was butt ass naked, but the only downside was that the room was very vacant Except next to the bed there was this note on the dresser, while I'm tryin' to deal with this hangover head pressure With a smile I grabbed the note, lit a smoke and sat back, "Dear whoever, lose my number P.S. the sex was wack" <EOS>
<BOS> If I recall correctly It was the middle of spring Walkin with my boys Contiplating what summer will bring We started talkin about girls And it was the funniest thing As I started to remember some of the funniest things  See there was ashley, She caught my eye the second that she pasted me I kissed her once Then she started to harrase me She called all night long I had to buy a brand new phone  And let me see There was mellony To have a mouth like that should be a felony Wouldn't believe half the shit that she was tellin me I mean dirty vocab She used to talk like she was crunk  And after that was tiffany The one with the cute cousin Are you kiddin' me? She had a man But that didn't mean shit to me He tryed to catch us all the time But I was just to god dam smooth  And I can't forget to mention Carrie But that situation quickly got scary Cuz after 2 days she was like lets get married Can you believe that shit? I had to pack my bags and move!  They say I gotta change my evil ways And I'm workin hard at it every day but No matter what i do I seem to make the same mistakes that I'm tryin not to If love is just a game that people play And practice make perfect is what they say but No matter what I do I seem to make the same mistakes that I'm tryin not to  I'll always remember Monica The jewish chick She'd always give me gifts for Chanukkah To met her folks she'd try and make me rock a yhomica But she looked so dam good She almost made my ass convert  And after that there was Lisa She had a twin sister, Teresa I bumped into them at Cam's gettin pizza The greatest night of my life Schleps to rock that kill to birds  And there was Erica She had the stankest breath in North America, I tryed to slip her tic tacs But they were scared of her And when we made out I always had to plug my nose  And I supose your know the sister Shoot, I swear by hand and God I only kissed her I gotta foot fetish But she gotta lota blisters I mean hammer time feet You think she had walked from Boca Raton  They say I gotta change my evil ways And I'm workin hard at it every day but No matter what I do I seem to make the same mistakes that I'm tryin not to If love is just a game that people play And practice make perfect is what they say but No matter what I do I seem to make the same mistakes that I'm tryin not to  Yo Matt, Remember Catherine? She talked so much I used to make her bring me aspirine Bla, bla bla bla I'm doin fine thanks for askin I even tryed to make a muzzle But her mouth would just not quite  Oh Shit Remember Shuana I hate to bring her up again I didn't want her That girl I talked about In "that girls a dog" song Yea the poster girl from pac sun Almost made me lose my grip  And oh shit There was Krystal The meth head She used to sniff like a fist full One time she chased me down thr street with a pistol She tryed to say I took her stash She bugged out and tryed to kill my ass  And at last we got Kimmy She went abroad Came back And broke up with me And so I ripped up all them letter that she sent me I cryed for like 3 days Then it was back to my evil ways  They say I gotta change my evil ways And I'm workin hard at it every day but No matter what I do I seem to make the same mistakes that I'm tryin not to If love is just a game that people play And practice make perfect is what they say but No matter what I do I seem to make the same mistakes that I'm tryin not to  They say I gotta change my evil ways And I'm workin hard at it every day but No matter what I do I seem to make the same mistakes that I'm tryin not to If love is just a game that people play And practice make perfect is what they say but No matter what I do I seem to make the same mistakes that I'm tryin not to <EOS>

<BOS> Hi, have you ever wondered what it would be like to listen to some music? Well this is your big chance. You see, music is much like a brochetted butterfly, with a shadowy prominade of effervescence, yet sloos down the bottom of misty moutains of darkness. Like a flirtatious flounder upon a non-reflecting mirror. God, what is this opaque window of comfort, that we cannot overcome? It is a manafestation of love. It a forest of emtpiness and it is an ocean with no water except where that which fills it. So as you listen to this masterpiece release yourself from the prison of captivity and let your soul free. Because only a free soul can be captured by greedy soul theives. Who will have sold it to Leprechaun gold miners. But it is only when your soul is taken away, that you can take it back. And this my friend, does not make any sense whatsoever, or does it, no it does not. Ladies and Gentlemen I give you The Papercut Chronicles. <EOS>

<BOS> (chorus)I see a window and all i can think about is, So do you wanna fly with me Do you wanna fly with me. I know it sounds crazy but I can't find solid ground, So Do you wanna fly with me, Do you wanna fly with me.  (Verse 1) And i've been staring out this window for the past eleven hours, thinking of all the opportunities this window has to offer, from the twenty third floor and a filing cabinet east manhattan and FDR is beautiful as I'm watching all the cars passing. Then a couple stars twinkle so I started laughing and a couple walked by and they look so happy. I booked this room at this place called the last resort, All my bags are packed, I got my jacket and my passport and a first class ticket to the afterlife, you dig me? Now is you is or is you aint with me? And i fully understand if you've got other plans, But i can't see you hand in hand with another man. I been on auto-pilot since we last spoke, And i dont wanna board this flight on a bad note. I want you to think about it, but either way I'm going And if you really love me, then here's your chance to show it.  (Chorus)I see a window and all i can think about is, So do you wanna fly with me Do you wanna fly with me. I know it sounds crazy but I can't find solid ground, So Do you wanna fly with me, Do you wanna fly with me. (2x) We'll live forever and maybe we'll write a novel about our love.  (Verse 2) She looked me dead in the eyes and took me by the hand Kissed me on my cheek and said,"Baby listen i understand, You don't have to leave, plus I'm scared of heights, So just put down your luggage, and just forget this flight. You and I, you know we been through a lot of things, But it's no reason to start trippin' and arguing." She said,"You are my king and i place no one above you, And i don't have to board a plane for me to show i love you. And all this talk about the afterlife is kinda creepy So let's just go lay down and talk, I'm getting kinda sleepy." I kinda smiled and we both walked to the window, I pulled the shutters, started staring at the sky. I wiped a couple tears away, then we looked at each other and i could see the stars twinkle in her eyes. I told her about the couple that I saw earlier. She said, "I'ms sure they were cute but they're no you and I."  (Chorus)I see a window and all i can think about is, So do you wanna fly with me Do you wanna fly with me. I know it sounds crazy but I can't find solid ground, So Do you wanna fly with me, Do you wanna fly with me. (2x) We'll live forever and maybe we'll write a novel about our love.  by _gu <EOS>

<BOS> The more I meditate, I hesitate to even show face The more I hesitate, I contemplate my life is a waste My spirit levitates to take a glance at truth of its grace As my flesh emulates every act of disgrace So deceptive in perception of its hunger and greed Maliciously relentless to fulfill whatever it needs Undisciplined, rebellious, no regard for righteousness Ever since it tasted death, he desires nothing less Too many nights I spent in tears, drowning in fear I’m never making it, through all the time I spend faking it My soul is proving capability and prone that when alone Without the father’s consecration flesh manipulates Constantly, continual battles might end up being goes through Why do I do the things I know I’m not supposed to Why don’t I do the things that I know I should do Who s to blame except me and me alone I found my enemies home  (Chorus) What could it inhibit a habit the dark corners lurking demonic principalities when other evils working you can’t escape fate, allow what’s in your heart to tailgate you’re your only cellmate to unlock what locked the jail gate (2X)  Somewhere inside the crevice, I long to face the limits The premise is death for execution of flesh past no authority and so control the tree of life I chose, taking shape of its mold Indulge in fruit too, whatever you do, I do, we crew Give it unto a city, evil, not for me, you you Doom can’t loom if I no longer give it room zoom a zoom You’re free to explode for miles with a loud boom Perfect tightly I hold with no attention To foe toe to toe and low to low, flow to flow I stand firm Learn to discern, circumstances are changed Do a dance with death, til my soul’s last breath When I’m at my hardest Can salvage my image tarnish What can make me whole again The blood of Jesus Freed a deed Down the slanted hill I ski high speed Manage to get bandaged when I got tree (chorus)  What lies in a man’s soul…  I found that evil doesn’t have a face, so let alone a place It just lingers in the void over an open space Searching out a victim To nuzzle up against, take under its wing, and habit, then reign supreme Think it control, it slowly conquers a man’s soul Behold real TV, even real is when it takes its toll Unfold, with those punches, you don’t have to roll Toss yourself at the cross, and escape the devil More vibrant than the radiant redhead W/ flashlights, the fingers, the illuminated words of Christ Put that on ice for a spell, pray tell, how in the world do you excel in the glory of God, and then rebel Letting death valley give you a fear falling down It will only breed your fears when you allow it to hang around So get down, hit knees where prayers don’t cease What’s lurking probably shouldn’t even be working <EOS>

<BOS> I knew this kid named Alberto Funny style cat And his girl looked like a turtle Not Lisa Turtle, just a turtle High school track He ran the hurdle His peers shed tears senior year when he got murdered Now Alberto was your average A student Participated in class, Never came late And never truant His family was picture perfect His older sister was prom queen His dad a decorated vet from the Vietnam team His mother was Dear Abby, An ordinary house wife Like clockwork, always had dinner on the table at 5 But Alberto had a monster he kept under his bed Instead of letting it out, He just got a girlfriend instead She knew something was funny Shecould tell by his behavior Or the way he flamboyantly shook his hand When he would wave to her She thought nothing of it And just shoved it in the closet Until the day that word dripped out like leaky faucet Alberto was homosexual I ain't have nothing against it But little Ronnie Johnson and all his football player friends did They'd always pick and nag Call him "fag" and such and such And couldn't wait to get to gym so they could really bust his nuts The gym teacher never cared He'd just join in on the action He'd make silly gestures And compared him to Micheal Jackson Alberto couldn't take it He'd just stop showing up and whenever he walked them halls He just felt like throwin' up And night he would cry and cry and ask "God why?" Like "God, why the fuck'd I have to be born this way?" God would reply, "Son, you've gotta show 'em you're more than gay" Cause he had dreams to be a track star Until that warm April night Them gay jokes went way too far Ronnie begged for his forgiveness And invited him to a party Cause his parents went away And left him plenty of Bacardi Alberto kindly accepted He was finally accepted Except it was all deception And left them all unprotected It was a plan Ronnie had scammed To get him in the right place Verbally degrade and rearrange his pretty face The plan would go swiftly They started calling him sissy One punch turned into fifty They beat him till he was dizzy Now Alberto lie in blood While his peers look on in fear He took his last breath And passed away his senior year  Needless to say It was one big tragedy And how was Ronnie gonna explain to his family, While they were on vacation taking in sights He got wasted and killed a kid that night  Don't be a slave and behave the way they do, Just utilize the gifts that God gave you [x4]  I knew this girl named Maria Bright and talented With aspirations to be a Big superstar What a great idea Until she fell off and started to listening to her peers Oh dear! Now Maria was your typical obnoxious Analytical head strong rebel Flippin' off the principal Single mother home structure She looked after baby brother While mom worked two jobs Just to buy supper Pops was a struggling musician Troubled man, Juggling family and heroin addiction He overdosed and left a notice of eviction And a crate of records on the table in the kitchen And a little angel with a keen sense of sound Who saw silence in the records she found And she would stay up late at night Reciting songs to herself Under pale moonlight Righting wrongs that her pops made, Promised her mom she'd never go that same route Turns out Carrie Anne had other plans Her and her man Ronnie most popular, Second best to nobody Homecoming queen versus ugly duckling And the story ends the same way Ok, Ronnie's parents went away for a couple of days And told him "No Drinking" What the fuck were they thinking? Maria was oblivious that her boyfriend had already been invited So when Carrie Anne asked She got all excited Like "damn now I got something to look forward to" Or so she thought Maria kindly accepted, Except it was all bullshit Not pay attention, Carrie Anne hated Maria cause she could sing So she scored a bag of heroin But the craziest thing was Maria never touched drugs, she did that night And when her man was getting beat She was nowhere in sight Now her boyfriend lie in blood And she had no idea Alberto passed away and she got hooked her senior year Needless to say It was one one big tragedy And I hate to break it but It doesn't end happily A warm day in May, The sky was so beautiful Carrie Anne died in a crash leaving the funeral <EOS>
